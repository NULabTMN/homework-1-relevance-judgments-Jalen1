          The Sixteenth Amendment
          The Constitution of the Unit
          ed StAtfls was mimnsplv maAo Aif
          icultj to amend. Madison, the
          Father of the Constitution, was
          against 'innovation' and Hamil-'
          ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
          ging people. So the Constitution'
          was made unchangeable except b.
          a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
          and three-fourths of the State
          , Legislatures or State Conventions.
          One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
          day, if prperly placoed, can block'
          any amendment. Of the four,
          hundred and thirty-five amend-'
          wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
          noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
          belief of many people that the;
          Constitution can never be amend-'

          "We, on 'the other hand, believe ,
          Amendment permiting the income1
          tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
          cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
          mously adopted by the Senate,
          and. almost unanimously by the
          House. Thirty-five of the forty
          six States must ratify, but thirty-five
          States will be found. The
          South is for it; the west is for
          it; the real people of the East
          are for it; the two parties have
          declared in. its favor and Presi
          dent Taft has taken his stand on
          it. It is more than the mere
          question of an income tax, al
          though that is important. It is a
          question of national sovereignty,
          of the right of ninety millions of
          petTple to tax. themselves as they
          deem just and expedient. It is
          an issue upon which in times of
          danger the national welfare, ev
          en the national existence, might
          depend. The Sixteenth Amend
          ment nnist and will be adopted.
          But it will not be adopted by
          the people staying at. home and
          wishing for it. It must be made
          an issue in every 'State, in every
          assembly district. Time fights
          on the side of the Sixteenth
          Amendment; there is no limit.
          Once a State adopts it, the rati
          fication lasts' forever. But if
          the ratification is not made the
          first session, H may be again pro-,
          posed for 'the second, " third,

          THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT
          IN THE LOUISIANA
          LEGISLATURE.
          (To the Caucasian)
          As shown by the House Journal of
          1910 the Sixteenth Amendment to the
          Constitution of the United States was
          endorsed by the popular branch of the
          General Assembly as follows
          Mr. Johnson of Washington intro
          duced House Concurrent Resolution
          No. t, ratifying the Sixteenth Amend
          mient to the Constitution of the United
          States, which was referred to the corn
          nittee on Federal relations. "House of Representatives, State of
          Loutiiana, Baton Rouge, La., May 20,
          19to.-To the Honorable the Speaker
          and Members of the House of Repre
          sentatives of the State of Louisiana
          Gentlemen : I ant directed by your com
          mittee on Federal relations to submit
          the following report : House Concurrent
          Resolution No. i, by Mr. Johnson (of
          Washington) ratifying the Sixteenth
          Amendment to the Constitution of the
          United States (here printing the reso
          lution). Favorably.
          "W. E. RICHARI)SON,
          "Chairman.'On June 2 this substitute was indefin
          itely postponed on motion of Mr. John
          son of Washington by a rising vote of
          68 yeas and 31 nays. The question then
          recurred on the motion to adopt 'the
          resolution to ratify the amendment. The
          roll being called resulted as follows:
          Yeas 78; nays 3t; absent 7.
          Thus it is seen that the House voted
          overwhelmingly in favor of the Income
          Tax Amendment.
          But in the Senate-As shown by the
          Senate Journal the Sixteenth or Income
          Tax Amendment was overwhelmingly
          defeated.
          On June 7 the House Concurrent Res
          olution by Mr. Johnson was so amended
          as to refer the said Sixteenth Amend
          ment to a general State primary elec
          tion for ratification or rejection by the
          qualified electors, said vote to be binding
          on the next General Assembly. The vote
          on this amendment was yeas 26, nays
          ii, absent 4. The Johnson Concurrent Resolution
          having thus been materially amended by
          the Senate was sent back to the House
          for concurrence in the Senate amend
          ment. The House refused to concur,
          and the amended resolution was sent to
          conference, both houses appointing con
          ferrees. There the Johnson resolution
          rests, and the Sixteenth Amendment
          failed of ratification in so-called Demo
          cratic Louisiana. On the South rests
          the responsibility. But the Democrats
          will elect a new General Assembly in
          1912. The "Conser
          sal ion Commissioni" one of Sanders' pet
          tchi nes t owring more money from the

          is, this autocratic comumission, which
          has been invested with absolute power
          and unlimited authority, did not impose
          a tax on the air we breathe. That will
          corie later, perhaps, unless the people
          conclude to put all of Sanders' "com
          missions," with which he is amply Sup
          plied, out of business at the general
          election in 1912.

          This Resolution and Another
          Providing for Ratification
          of Income Tax Amend
          ment Will Be Rushed
          Through
          Rules
          have been adopted sufficient for the
          legal transaction of legislative busi
          ness and as soon as the decks are
          cleared for action this morning a
          concurrent resolution will be intro
          duced in both houses., submitting to
          the people an amendment to the con
          stitution providing for the recall of
          judges, and it will be passed quicker
          than either President Taft or the
          proletariat can say Jack Robinson.
          .Colore the smoke clears away a joint
          resolution will drift in. to the effect
          that Arizona endorses the proposed
          sixteenth amendment to the constitu
          tion of the United States, providing
          for an income tax. Thirty-one states
          have already endorsed it and only five
          more are needed. There will be one
          less today and the time has arrived
          for the plutocrats to throw up their
          hands, or at least stand up and be
          counted.
          After this deed has been done C. B.
          Wood will seize the earliest oppor- j
          tunity in the senate and Don Babbitt;
          in the house, to present Arizona's j
          formal ratification of the sixteenth
          amendment to the constitution of the!
          United States. These gentlemen did
          not have time to senu for the original
          copy in Washington to incorporate a
          picture in their resolution, but will
          have to express their sentiments in
          the artistic hand of an official typist.

          The question
          .of federal control of waterpowers and
          power sites, upon which conservation
          forces have centered, much of. their
          fight during the last few-years, IB to
          be brought before the senate this week
          when efforts' will be made to pass the
          first bill establishing the government's
          right to license, control, and tax a

          river.
          "In 1911, for the first time since
          1883, postal receipts exceeded postal
          expenditures, leaving a surplus in
          sieud of a deficit. A heavy loss of
          revenue in 1912 due to the extraordin
          ary amount of franked matter mailed
          In the political campaign, created a
          temporary deficit but since the close
          of the fiscal year, the income of the
          department again has outstripped ex
          penses.
          "The year preceding the present ad
          ministration was marked ly the larg
          est postal deficit on record amounting
          to $17,500,000. During the next two
          years the deficit was greatly reduced
          and later eliminated. When compared
          with the financial showing of four
          years ago the reports of Income and
          expense for subsequent years indicate
          an aggregate saving of about 45,000,.

          Charleston, W. Va., Feb. 1.—By an
          unanimous vote the West Virginia leg
          islature late today ratified the inconu

          Tho committee is confronted with
          the problem of raising from $325,
          000,000 to $350,000,000 from customs
          duties coupled with a pledge of low
          ering the tariff bars on necessities. Of
          this total figure, the plan is to pro
          vide between $$5,000,000 and $100,
          000.000 by an income tax, now lacking
          but one state for ratification of the
          proposed constitutional a nendment.
          The income tax. in turn, vould em

          A fairly well determined program
          is already in dictation. In the main,
          according to the democrats, :he chem
          ical, iron and steel, wool, tton and
          free list bills will be like the previous
          ones, but there will be numerous
          changes dictated by new ligbL thrown
          on individual articles. The democratic
          majority already is strongly commit

          the revenues by $fi3,000,00n and free

          of the constitution of the United

          Sixteenth Amendment.
          Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi
          sion authorizing an income tax as now
          i?nnen.?nP£rtknown
          .of
          the federal
          constitu­
          tion will be as the "Sixteenth
          Amendment" and reads as follows:
          Article XVI.—The congress shall
          have power to lay and collect taxes on
          incomes, from whatever source de-
          w'",ou'
          apportionment among
          the states, and without regard to any
          census or enumeration."
          The change in the fundamental la'V
          or the land marks a new epoch in the
          American tax system. For the first,
          time congress is given specific authori
          ty by a provision of the federal con
          stitution to levy an income tax. All
          previous efforts for a tax of this kind
          have been without the explicit author
          ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
          change also marks a broad develop
          ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
          torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
          lar to the systems now in force in
          Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
          Spain and various other countries.
          New Source of Revenue.
          Probably the most important aspect
          of an income tax. as now authorized
          by the constitution, is that it adds a
          new source of revenue for the govern
          ment. At present the two great
          sources of government revenue aro
          customs duties levied by tariff acts on
          goods imported from foreign coun
          tries and internal revenue taxes on
          tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
          tain other articles. Each of these
          sources at present produces a little
          less than half of the total revenues
          of the government. In 1911 the total
          government revenues were $700,100,
          906 and of this customs duties yielded
          $11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
          taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
          mainder came from sales of public
          lands, the corporation tax and various
          miscellaneous sources. Under an in
          come tax, however, a new and far
          reaching source of revenue ls provid
          ed for the government, and this will
          in turn reduce the amounts required
          rfom the other sources of revenue,'
          customs and internal revenue, in or
          der to meet the expenses of govern
          ment. This last phase is likely to have
          an important bearing on tariff legis
          lation as hereafter enacted.
          Before the amendment formally be
          comes a part of the constitution to.
          day's action of the legislature must be
          transmitted to the secretary of state
          at Washington and proclamation of
          the ratification made.
          First Step In 1909.
          The first official step toward amend
          ing the constitution so as to authorise
          specifically an income tax was taken
          by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
          unanimous vote, that body adopted a
          resolution, submitting this amend
          ment to the legislatures of the respec
          tive states. Only a few days later, on
          July 12, the house passed the resolu
          tion by a vote of 317 to 14.

          Washington, Feb. 5. Here is the
          Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
          stitution of the United States, rati
          fied Monday:
          "Article XVI. The Congress shall

          out regard to any census or enumer
          a'ion." Wyoming had the honor of mak
          ing the amendment effective. With
          in two hours after word was received
          that the Wyoming Legislature had
          ratified the amendment, a telegram
          was received by Senator RichardHon,
          of Delaware, Btating that his State
          had also ratified the amendment,
          and to this was added New Mexico,
          making thirty-eight States to act
          favorably, Utah and New Jersey
          are expected to do the same. Only
          thirty-six were needed.
          The Democrats tariff makers of
          the House and Senate forthwith an
          nounced that thby would begin pre
          parations at once to enact an income
          tax law a3 a part of the Democratic
          tariff programme at the coming ex
          tra (Session of Congress. Senator
          Simmons, of North Carolina, who
          will probably be the next chairman
          of the Finance Committee, spoke
          for the Senate. Representative Hull,
          of Tennessee, the income tax expert
          of the Ways and Means Committee.
          spoke for the House.
          Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
          ka, Republican, author of the
          amendment, which he introduced in
          the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
          pardonable pride, announced to the
          Senate during the afternoon that
          three-fourths of the sovereign States
          had ratified it. He congratulated
          the Senate and the country on the
          result. The amendment will not be
          come actually a part of the Constitu
          tion until the notice of the ratifi
          cation by Wyoming or Delaware has
          been formally filed with the Senator
          of StatP, which will doubtless be
          within a few days.
          The Democrats propose to raise
          approximately $100,000,000 a year
          by the new tax and to graduate it
          so that persons of great wealth will
          pay at a higher rate.

          The Sixteenth Amendment.
          The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
          States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
          two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
          power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
          derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
          out regard to any census or enumeration."
          Congress having been given this power what is its duty ? We
          believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
          Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress ; that the
          amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
          not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
          demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
          giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
          arise.
          As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good ? We
          think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
          the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
          income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
          For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
          ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
          three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
          fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
          Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
          practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
          The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
          or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
          were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
          of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
          wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
          type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
          of the people.
          The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
          gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
          should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
          ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
          ing it up ; that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
          government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
          his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
          some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
          ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
          the rich, where we believe it belongs.
          But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
          a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
          already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
          tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
          one.
          It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
          from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
          from others : that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay

          Obituary.
          Ambrose M. Emery, son of Win. and
          Mary Emery, was born Oct. 14, 1871 In
          Highland county, Ohio, and died Dec.
          .11, 1012, aged 41 years, 2 months and
          17 days.
          He became a member of the M. E.
          church when he was 14 years old.
          He lias lived the most of his life in
          more than the man, whose income is derived from investments and this neighborhood.
          fluctuates. Admit that this is true, what of it ? If we never make
          any arrangements for the levy and collection of taxes until we are
          certain that everyone will pay his share, we would never collect
          any taxes.
          Congress has been given the power to pass an income tax law
          because the people want such a law and they have given them the
          power so that the law will be passed at once and not in the dim and
          distant future.
          When you hear a man condemning an income tax law as unjust,
          unfair, an invasion of the rights of the people, it is a good bet that
          his income is so large that he will have to pay on it.

          INCOME TAX LAW
          AGAIN ATTACKED.
          Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
          for Union Pacific Railroad stock
          holders and others have filed a brief
          in the Supreme Court attacking as
          unconstitutional the income tax
          provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
          tariff law.
          The attorneys contend that while
          the sixteenth amendment empowers
          congress to impose a tax on "incomes
          from whatever source derived," the
          framers of the law stretched it to
          cover many taxes other than on in
          come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
          constitutional authority for taxing a
          specific class of persons, unmarried
          men, more than others, or for the
          super-tax imposed upon men with
          incomes over $20,000.

          Washington, D. C., Oct. 13.—An an
          nual revenue to the government of
          $82,000,000 depends on the outcome of
          arguments today before the supreme
          court on the constitutionality of the
          income tax. The first cases to reach
          the court under the new system of fed
          eral taxation and the first Involving
          the construction of the sixteenth
          amendment were at issue.
          Attacking the law were corporations
          objecting to the law in part and as an
          entirety mining companies voicing
          objections to the tax on mining In
          come and individuals, attacking prin
          cipally the additional tax on incomes
          in excess of $20,000. The main de
          fense of the law has been prepared by
          the government.

          INCOME TAX VALID,
          SAYS SUPREME COURT
          The Decision Was Unanimous One.
          Expected Levies on Great Fortune.
          Will Be Made, Etc.
          Washington -The income tax was
          declared constitutional Monday by the
          tion which swept aside every conttn
          tion riisieti agatinst it and, in the api
          itli of 'Ocll rs' aional leaders, opened
          the way for increasing the tax rat- on
          great fortunes to help pay for nati,,n
          alt defense.
          The decision was rannounced by
          Chief Justice Whitn and was unani
          of Ferank i. lrushaber from the ac
          tion of thi Ne York fte eral court
          in refusing to enjoin the Southern Pa
          cific, of which Irusohaber was a stock
          holder, from payning the tax. The
          case raised substantially every point
          involved in all the five income tax
          allowing mining corporations to make
          a 5 per cent deduction annually from
          gross income for depletion of mines.
          an amendment to the old corporation
          tax, rather than a feature of the in
          come tax.
          The basic error of those who at
          tacked the constitutionality of the
          tax, Chief Justice White held, was in
          regarding the sixteenth amendment as
          ia direct tax without apportionment
          tion. In fsubstance, thoe court held the at
          the sixteenth amendment had not em
          potereod the federal overnment tao
          levy a new taxe out that "the whole
          purpose of the amed ofment was to re-v
          alieve all inco me taxes froain a consid
          ieratherion of the aso rcfet whe nce the in
          come was derived."

        <text> STOCK RETURNS ARE NOT TAXABLEUNDER1916 LAW Supreme Tribunal Sustains New York Jurist
          in Decision on Macomber Test Case. Stock dividends are not taxable un der the 1916 income
          tax law, the United States Supreme Court decided today. A test caso was brought by Mrs.
          Myrtle H. Macomber in the New York Federal courts to recover taxes paid on 1,100 shares of
          stock of Standard Oil of California given as a stock dividend The loA'er courts decided in
          her favor and the Government, through Mark Kisner, then collector of Internal revenue for
          New York, ap pealed the rase to the Supreme Court. The declsloti of the lower court was
          sustained by the Supreme Court. The decision upholding that of the lower court was handed
          down by Jus tice Iltney. .Justices Holmes, Day, Iirandeis hnd f'lark dl*s?\nted. "A stock
          dividend representing profits is income, no matter what the condition, in the opinion of
          lawyers, business men, bankers." said .lustice Rrandels. "It has been held Income by
          courts in California, in New York, In dissenting States. Massachusetts is one State In
          which n stock divi dend was not held income." Justice I'ittiey said: "From every point of
          view, we are brought Irresistjbly to, the conclu sion that neither under the sixteenth
          amendment nor otherwise lias Con gress power to tax without appor tionment a true stock
          dividend made lawfully and In good faith, or the ac cumulation of profits behind It. as
          Income of the stockholder. The rev? nu act of 1916, Insofar as It Imposes
          a tax upon the stockholder, because
          of such dividend, violates the pro
          visions of Article 1, section 2,
          clause n, and Article I, section 0,
          elouse 4, of the Constitution and to
          this extent is Invalid notwithstand
          ing the sixteenth amendment."

          the hurden on the poor people and made
          possible the evasion of hundreds of mill
          ions nf taxes. With tho declaration by
          the court that taxation of stock divi
          dends Is unconstitutional, notwithstand
          ing tho Sixteenth Amendment, Congress
          leaders doubted If there was any legis
          lative step now by which the same pur

          feared that aConstltutlonnl amendment
          on the point might not etand.
          The case just decided was appealed
          to the Supreme Court 'by the Government

          The majority opinion was emphatic
          In its declaration that the word "In

          whllo Justice Brandels In his dissenting
          opinion declared tho word "income"
          should be construed "as the people of
          tho United States In general believe It

          Tho court hold that the onlv nucstlon
          to decide was what was i dividend
          capital or dividend and intimated that
          the fact that this system waa used to

          Justices Brandels and Clarke differed

          The dissenting opinion of Justices
          Holmes and Day was based on the
          ground that the court misinterpreted
          ine meaning of the words stock dlv
          dend, and that it is clearly a dividend
          and taxable,
          One of tho points raised by the ma.
          lority was that nothing moro clearly
          Miowed that a stock dividend Is not
          Income than tho fact that to pay a tax
          on such a dividend one would have to
          eii other stocks or obtain revenue from
          oilier sources.

          amendment will be for the election of the United States
          senators by a direct vote of the people. If that amend
          ment is ever suumitted to the people there is no doubt
          but that it will carry by a ten to one vote. The people
          would like to see that direct vote proposition go a step
          further and elect the president of the United States in
          the same way, but that will not be done until the South
          holds elections on the square and in the open.

          The Sixteenth Amendment.
          It has been forty-three years since
          the Constitution of the United States
          has been amended, and it is doubtful if
          during that period there has been a
          single session of Congress when some
          sort of amendment was not attempted.
          An income tax was
          provided once before in the Gorrman-
          Wilson tariff law, but it was declared
          unconstitutional, and hence it has al
          ways been an open question whether
          that tariff law would have been suc
          cessful had it retained the boosting
          support of an income tax. Democratic
          statesman are congratulating themselves
          over the sixteenth amendment. It has
          been declared a piece of luck
          equal to the gold discoveries following
          the election of President McKinley,
          which made certain—if there had been
          any previous doubt, of the efficiency of
          a gold standard for our monetary system.

          The dissenting opinion of the su
          preme court in the stock dividend case
          well said:
          "If stock dividends representing
          profits are held exempt from taxa
          tion under the sixteenth amendment,
          the owners of the most successful
          businesses in America will be able
          to escape taxation on a large part of
          what is actually their income.
          "So far as their profits are rep
          resented by stock received as div
          idends they will pay these taxes not
          upon their income, but upon the in
          come of their income.
          "That such result was intended by
          the people of the United States when
          adopting the sixteenth amendment is
          inconceivable. Our sole duty is to
          ascertain their interest as therein ex
          pressed."

        <text> -THIE SIXTEENTH AMEND. MENT, By Frederio J. Haskin. The ratification of the Sixteenth
          amendment to the constitution and the determination of the Wilson ad ministration to
          follow it up with an income tax law marks one of the most important pages in the history
          of American taxation. It probably rep resents the beginning of a new era in the
          application of the revenue rais ing policies of the federal government. On the one hand it
          settles many ques tions about which there has been much dispute, while on the other hand
          it opens up new fields of argument and contention which will probably figure in the forum
          of American poli tics for many years to come. It there fore becomes of paramount interest
          among the questions in the public mind. And moreover, it gives to the people an issue they
          can feel, a tax that they do not paw unconsciously. A person who buys, something upon
          which a customs duty has been levied knows nothing of what the govern ment levies upon him
          in the transac tion-unless he happens to be coming through one of the ports and gets held
          up for duties on what he has bought abroad. But the salaried man who finds $50 deducted
          from his sal ary to pay his income tax knows it with a good deal of certainty. The
          Sixteenth amendment came about In a rather unusual way. When the congress met to make the
          Payne Aldrich tariff law there had devel oped a widespread sentiment in favor of an income
          tax. The revenues of the government were not meeting the expenditures, and nearly
          everybody agreed that the tariff was already too high. In looking about to find some other
          source of revenue most eyes fell upon the income tax. It is true that there was a supreme
          court de cision which had declared the income tax an unconstitutional tax, if levied
          without apportionment among the states, but that decision was made by ctla it And s it waa
          that Y s t tenat Ahe ond thought. T it Ink s more pronounced y every p vioue s d io ndred
          years seemed tp b by the second decision of r There was a de tio Ia some quarters to put
          th e up to ,the court a*i, and t tuih it looked as if the the :Balley Cumrding ai 8rt o
          the 'Payne Aldrich la pro r' the enact men 't Of an" Inco i t ,would' be. able ton mulstr
          enoI votes in the senate and hottie td ar it. At this juncture' Presideat came upoi the
          scene with a e to congress expressang the v t the supreme court thad takon a m the federal
          governmneat a poweit was generalhl sup.%oed to hie i d one that it undoubtedly ought t te.
          He added that It might. be n:~ces~ary for the salvation of the copgi*h in time of a great
          crisis. He said, ,hoWever, that he thought it would be much better to make sure of that
          right through the medium of a constitutional allietiin ent than by putting on the
          statute., bqoks a law al ready there and never repealed. He thought it would not add to
          the popu lar confidence in the `ourts for con gress to enact a law upon lines that had
          been declared uu tistitutional. It may be said in passi~g that Mr. Taft, as well as many
          ati9'ter statesman fell into an amusring eror concerning the income tax 'laW o .1894, when
          he said it was still hiir:h the statute books. As a mattei~ o fact, the very second line
          of the adt..rovtided for its own expiration by..i:.tation in. 1900. He therefore teot
          el0ded that con gress pass a conUtittitlonal amend ment to constituitionillze an income
          tax law, and that, pending the passage of such an amendme t a corporation tax be levied.
          Many .rnembers of the senate and house professed to see In this an effort to prevent the
          immedi ate passage of an income tax law, and for the time being opposed it. Finally,
          however, they accepted the ine% itable and joined in voting to send the amendment to the
          legislatures of the states for ratification. Many of them thought that those who backed
          the amendment were doing so as a means to choke off impending income tax legislation and
          to strengthen the su preme court's last decision by offering the amendment and have it
          fall of ratification by the states. Then, they contended, the court further could say that
          the people had rejected the in come tax idea and thbt it was not for the court to set'Ul.'
          wh~t the people had t'hrown down... ':..3 But in spite of all 'these conflicting ideas,
          the proposed in.ome tax law failed of passage. I~ while ,both houses of congress promptly
          gave the states the right to say whether they wanted an income tax 1aw or not. If any of
          those who ~oted for the amendment did so under the assump tion that it would first defeat
          the pro posed income tax law an'd then be de feated itself by tlg' euPcpc6ncurrence of 12
          states, they- rec oned without their host, for the Sieeth amend ment is now a part of the
          supreme law of the land. But it did not become the Sixteenth amendment until it had first
          revealed that questions may arise concerning t.at questions may arise concerning its
          interpretation almost as serious as s those concerning the ",'direct tax" clause of the
          constitutidn, which it was aimed to settle. Justice Hughes, now of the supreme court, was
          gov ernor of the state of New York when c the legislatures were asked to ratify 1 it He
          recommended that it be re- i jected, one of his grounds of objec- f tion being that it
          would tax state, I county and municipal bonds, and I therefore give the federal government
          practically
          complete domination over 1
          the states. The amendment says: 1
          "The congress shall have power to lay
          and collect taxes on incomes -from
          whatever source derived=J without ap
          portionment among the several states
          and without regard to any census
          enumeration." It was contended that
          thc words "from whateve' source de
          rived" gives to congress the unques
          tioned power to tax state and local
          securities to whatever point it nhooses,
          even to the point of destroying the
          credit of the divisions issuing them.
          It would seem to the lay mind that
          "from whatever source derived"
          would include everything, and so a
          great many people hold. They con
          tend that inasmuch as it is the last
          word it naturally repeals anything in
          consistent with it. On the other hand,
          such a lawyer as Senator Root op
          poses this doctrine. He contends that
          the amendment does not enlarge il
          the slightest the scope of the taxing
          power of the federal goverllrnenit and
          that its only effect will be to relieve
          the exercise of that tal.ag PoWer;
          from the requirement that the tax
          shall be apportioned among thl Ltateq.
          So we see that If the prefi.ent con-
          gress shall enact a law thg in-·
          comes derived from state ;and local
          securities there will probably be anh I
          other great legal fight a4id another
          income tax decision. t -is generally
          believed, however, that while congress
          will not waive its power to tarx puchl
          securities, it will not embrace them in
          the forthcoming law. '
          The income tax amendment took a
          little more than three years to nego
          tiate the tortuous channels of legisla
          tive approval by the states. In this
          respect it fared much better than was
          expected even by Its friends. There
          have been only four amendments to
          the organic law in more than a cen
          tury, and three of these w-ere civil
          war amendments. The Twelfth amend
          ment revised the electoral alystEaq, the
          Thirteenth freed the slaves. When
          i the Fourteenth amendment ' Was end
          ing it was ratified by Ohio anid.New
          Jersey, but :before the result Was pro
          claimed they Withdrew their ratifica
          r tions. At the same tiime, ievera
          southern states which had rejected it
          , had new legislatures put in by'th~1 r
          construction forces, and theft ratitfil
          Sit. By denying to Ohio and NeWZ Jer
          sey the right to rescind theft i atfi
          cations and by granting the southern
          states the right to rescind their re
          jections, a necessary three4-ourtbs of
          the states was secured, AbIQut the
          I same thing happened Wlt the Flit

          Story —Lawyer Uowe
          Missing.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 20.—Tbe arch
          conspirator, H. H. Holmes, accompa
          nied by Mrs. Pitzel and a pretty woman
          who calls herself Mrs. Holmes, arrived
          in this city today in the custody of De
          tective Crawford and Special Agent Perry
          •of the Fidelity Mutual Life association.
          Mrs. Piizel's 16 year old daughter, Meda,
          and her 1-year-old bay were also with
          the party. Mrs. Holmes disappeared
          soon after her arrival, and no clue to her
          whereabouts could be obtained. It is
          thought she is stopping at a hotel in the
          neighborhood of police headquarters.
          After tbe arrival, tbe party was
          closeted with Superintendent of Police
          Linden until late in the afternoon.
          When the conference was over. Detective
          Crawford detailed the story of tbe trip,
          tbe moat important feature of which
          was the relation by Mr. Holmes of the
          story of bis whole life. It reads like
          tbe moat sensational of romances.
          Holmes Bat beside tbe detective with
          handcuffs on. The train had scarcely
          emerged from the Boston depot before
          lie iried to bribe hie captor. He offered
          the detective $000 if ho would allow him
          to escape. He said he had frequently
          hypnotized persons, having acquired the
          r.rt from a coliege professor in the west.
          He said he could get the money from
          his wife or Mrs. Pitzel. Wben ho caw
          his words had no effect, he entered into
          general conversation aud told the story
          of hia life.
          He said he was raised in Burlington,
          Vermont, and was co well educated in
          the schools that at 15 he was a tencher.
          For some time afterward he went to
          collegia there and later in Detroit, Micb.
          Here he formed the acquaintance of a
          medical student, who, he said, fur
          nished the body in New York in the
          present caee. He refused to divulge
          hie name. During vacations tbey wonted
          on farrae to ruiee their college expeuees.
          but one summer tbey found theuiGelves
          without means, and then the medical
          man suggested the idea of getting a
          body and beating nn insurance com
          pany. This was 12 years ago.
          The doctor got his life insured for
          $12,000. They obtained a body in Chi
          cago, took it east, arranged the details
          id identification and successfully got !
          the money with which they continued j
          their studies. He refused to name the -
          company thus swindled. They worked
          the scheme afterwards with sncceis,
          obtaining sums ranging from $10 000 to
          $20,000.
          j Once Holmes got bis life insured for
          [ $20,000 He then went to a hotel in
          Rhode Inland. At that time be wore a
          beard. He secured a corpse in Chicago,
          cut off the head and took tbo body to a
          lonely spot not far from tbe hotel.' Then
          he ehaved off his beard, returned to the
          hotel, asked for Holrr.es and engaged a
          room to wait for him. He bad brought
          the head with him and burned it be
          yond recognition in the fireplace of the
          hotel. This scheme, however, fell
          through, the mother of big wife, when
          she discovered the scheme, threatening
          to tell tbe police, and Holmes fled to
          the west.
          Resuming his story he said that while
          living in Chicago about 18 months ago,
          he tell in with a type-writer girl and
          furnished a house on the outskirts
          where tbey lived together. A younger
          sister came to visit them and the
          woman grew so jealous of her that in a
          quarrel one day she struck her over
          the head with a etool and killed her.
          To save the woman with whom he
          lived, Holmes said he put the body in
          a trunk loaded with stones and sunk
          it in the lake.
          This girl had property in Texas, and
          he and Pitzel took it off her hands and
          sent her abroad. It waa worth, he said,
          $40,000, and after getting it in their
          hands they went through Texas buying
          carloads of horses on notes on this prop
          erty, but as they never had a legal title
          to the property, the notes were worth
          less, and it is for this affair they are
          wanted in Fort Worth. To save this
          property Holmes said he and Pitzel
          formed tbo scheme of swindling the Fi
          delity company. He told the detective
          that for the crimes he had committed
          he deßerved to be hanged a dozen
          times.
          Holmes is not lacking for money, as
          he himself admitted that at the present
          time he ih supporting nearly two dozen
          persons, including the girl murderess,
          her mother and an imbecile brother,
          two orphans in Chicago who live in one
          of his properties, three separate alleged
          wiveß and their children rtnd his own
          mother and father in Kankakee. He
          would not give the names of the women.
          He firmly maintained that Pitzel ie
          alive and in Snn Salvador, and that he
          will hear from him through the personal
          column of a certain newepaper,
          Mr. Ferry said that ac a result of the
          interview it had been decided to arrest
          a number of other persona whose names
          were not ready to be given out.
          Mr. Perry related in detail the story
          of Holmes' arrest in Boston and the
          manner in which Mrs. Pitzel was de
          coyed from Burlington. He said tbat in
          the secret conference today nothing had
          been said that would in tbe slightest
          degree refute his original theory that
          Pitzel had been murdered. Wben in
          the west be saw tbe parents of Mrs.
          Pitzel, and tbey told him their daugh
          ter had complained of the exorbitant
          fee charged by the St. Loniß lawyer—
          $2500. In corroboration of his murder
          theory, Mr. Perry said tbat he had from
          Mrs. Pitzel an exact description of
          her husband, agreeing in every respect
          with that of the corpse found in the
          Oallowhill street hoose. Mrs, Pitzel, he
          continued, was perfectly innocent of
          any complicity in the whole affair. She
          told Perry last night that she had re
          ceived only $5000 in cash. She said
          Holmeß had taken $5000 of the money
          and put it in a speculation in Port
          Worth in which Pitz9l was also Inter
          ested. Holmes told Perry that this was
          true. In Texas, Perry said, Holmes
          operated under the name of H. H.
          Pratt. He added that Pitzel and B. T.
          Lyman are one and tbe same man.
          MRS. PITZEL'S STORY.
          Hho Fairs Bar Hmliiud Is Really Dead.
          M-r Daughter Missing.
          Boston. Nov. 20.—Mrs. Carrie Pitiel,
          it is claimed, has made a full confession
          of the alleged insurance swindle. It is
          stated that she hae implicated Holmeß,
          at whose suggestion, it is claimed, she
          went to Burlington, Vt. She stated
          that Holmee substituted tbe alleged
          bogus body for that of her husband and
          collected the insurance, but she was
          kept in ignorance of the whereabouts
          of her husband, who disappeared at
          once. Since the affair she has been
          roaming round from place to place,
          prompted by Holmee, in eearcti of her
          hueband, and it waa through the hope
          that she would be sent to him that Bhe
          answered the telegrams of the detec
          tives. Now ahe fears that the body for
          which the insurance was paid was not a
          bogus one, but that of her hnsband.
          Mrs. Pitzel aleo fears that her daugh
          ter, Alice, who was the only one besides
          Holmes t > identify tha body, has been
          spirited away, as Bhe has completely
          disappeared and Holmes is the last one
          known to have seen her. Holmes as
          serts be left Alice and tbe other Pitzel
          children at their father's home in
          Detroit a month ago, and since then has
          heard nothing from him.
          Holmee further stand that wben he
          came to Boston on 'Tuesday last be in
          tended to take paesage for Berlin, but
          changed his mind, and before he could
          perfect other plana the detectives bad
          him.
          HOLMES' VICTIMS.
          Good Reason to Believe He Murdered
          tbe Williams Sisters.
          Fort Worth, Tex., Nov. 20.—There is
          every reason to bolieve that C. H.
          Holmee, who went by tbe name of O. C.
          Pratt in Fort Worth, ia guilty of mur
          dering Minnie X, Wiliiame und her sis
          ter Ann. The crime waa probably com
          mitted in Chicago, and in this crime a
          man who claimed here to be a
          citizen of Chicago and called himself
          Benton T. Lyman, is an accomplice,
          Some time iv February be came here
          from Chicago and placed on record a
          deed from one Bond to Lyman for ICO
          feet front on Husk und Second etreete.
          Bond got title by deed from Minnie
          R. Wiliiame, executed before a no
          tary, whoan name was said to be
          HolmeD. Oa this property Lyman
          beaaii the erection of a three-story
          huilding. Lyman had sold one lot to a
          Fort Worth citizen who, fearing the title
          wae clouded, began to invest gate. He
          found that Minnie R. Wiliiame wrote
          late in 1803 to her sister Miss Ann Wil
          ium*, of Midlothian, Texas, to come to
          Chicago, tnat she v. a a going to bs mar
          ried and go to Europo. The sister left
          for Chicago. No word ever came from
          either of tbe Bistere.
          Minnie K. Williams, by will, was left
          half a block of property in tbe heart of
          Fort Worth, valued at $60,000, and a
          farm valued at $15,000. Thiß property
          has all been alienated, ostensibly by
          Miss Wiliiame. A detective has recent
          ly been sent to find the girls, but no
          trace can be discovered.

          It Deepens as the Days
          Roll By.
          The Alleged Murdered Man
          Still Alive.
          Seen in Chicago Less Than Two
          Weeks Ago.
          Swindler Holmes' Trail of Crime—lie
          Was Often In Indianapolis- A.
          Third Woman Victim
          Discovered.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 21. —The Pitzel
          mystery deepens as time wears on. To
          day many theories in regard to the mys
          tery were knocked in the head by tbe
          announcement tbat 13. F. Pitzel, the
          supposed murdered man, was seen in
          Chicago less than two weeks ago. Pres
          ident Fouzof the Fidelity Life Insurance
          company said today:
          "This morning my Chicago represen
          tative telegraphed me tbat a Mr. Bryan,
          who is a bueiness man in Chicago, called
          on him and said that B. F. Pitzel was
          in tbat city less than two weeke ago.
          Mr. Bryan says be bas known Pitzel for
          many years, and had frequent business
          transactions with him, and it is impos
          sible fot him to be mietaken. When
          they met, Bryan did not know Pitzel
          wae euppoeed to be dead, and tbe two
          greeted each otber cordially and re
          paired to a near-by ealoon where they
          bad a drink together. Then tbey sep
          arated and Bryant saye he doee not
          know whether Pitzel was to remain in
          thecity or not. However, our men there
          and tbe Pinkerton detectives have taken
          up the clew, and it is my opinion that
          Pitzel will be produced within a few
          dayp."
          President Fcuz called on Mrs. Pitzel
          and her daughter at tbe Central station,
          tiday, and received valuable informa
          tion Irom tbe daughter in reference to
          her father. The daughter said she re
          numbered while walking with her fa
          ther one Sunday in Chicago that tbat
          latter bad said to her: "If you ever hear
          through the newspapers or any otber
          way tbat I iiave been found dead, do not
          believe it. I will be all right."
          Later on, while in Boson, she read
          the story ot her father's death in a news
          paper. As soon as she had finished the
          etory, Holmes said to her: "Do you re
          member what your father told you the
          afternoon you were walking in Chi
          cago?"
          Daring Mr. Fouz'e interview with the
          daughter, Mrs. Pilzal grew excited and
          exclaimed : "They have all deceived me,
          even my own daughter."
          Mrs. Pitzsl said she remembered re
          ceiving a letter from her daughter Alice
          in which she related her experience
          while coming east for the purpose of
          identifying her father's body. Alice
          etated that Howe and Holmes accom
          panied her and both were sociable with
          each otber on the trip east. This eets
          at reet the claim of Howe that be never
          met Holmes until introduced to him by
          President Fouz on hia arrival in this
          city.

          the insurance swindler, known ac

          The clerk says be believes be has Been
          her on tbe streets since the time she
          was supposed to have left. She wae
          about 13 years old
          Lawyer Albert W. Wishard was in
          structed by telegraph from Philadelphia
          to rile suite lor tbe recovery of money
          obtained by H. M. Howard, now under
          arrest ot Boston, part of which is on de

          ANOTHER WOMAN VICTIM.
          Chicago, Nov. 21. —Following cloae on
          tbe atory of tbe mysterious disappear
          ance of the Wiliiame aiatera at tbe hands
          of Holmee, tbe life inenrance swindler,
          comes a (iiird woman victim, namely
          Miss Kate Durkee. Miss Durkee had
          property. Documents representing the
          property came into the bands of H. H.
          Holmes by theft. The woman mysteri
          ously disappeared, and Holmes showed
          title to the property. Mies Durkee was
          not Miss Williams; she bad dark eyes
          aud hair, while Miss Williams waa a
          blonde. A year ago today 25 creditors
          oi H. H. Holmes met at tbe office of
          George B. Chamberlain and made a des
          perate effort to find out who and where
          Miss Durkee was. It waa supposed she
          was an accomplice of Holmes; tbat
          property, illegally obtained waa being
          trauaferred to her name. Tbe creditors
          wished to reach it. Suddenly Kate Dur
          kee dropped entirely from sight, like
          tbe Williams sisters, and left no trace
          behind.
          "I believe she waa murdered," said
          Chamberlain today. "I believe also
          tbat both Williams girls wore mur
          dered."
          Mr. Chamberlain, as proprietor of the
          Lafayette Mercantile agency, began an
          investigation of Holmee a year ago.
          Mtss DUBKBK FOUND.
          Miss Dnrkee bas not been murdered,
          Sbe has been found in Omaha. A dis
          patch from that city tonight saye:
          Miss Kate Durkee, lives here in
          this city witb ber brother, who is
          assistant auditor of tbe Burlington rail
          road. She expreeeed aurpriee wben
          asked concerning ber connection with
          Holmes' family in Chicago. She never
          heard of but one wife. Hie recently
          visited Mrs. Holraea and made Holmee
          transfer a piece of property in Chicago for
          ber. She refused to explain what prop
          erty this was, hut declared that Holmes'
          Chicago lawyer was familiar with the
          deal.
          Attorney Duncombe of this city said:
          "Holmes employed me to attend to
          some business for him, and in the courae
          of the action for which I waa retained it
          became necessary to take the deposition
          of Miss Kate Durkee. In her evidence
          she eaid she waa related to the wife of
          Holmeß."
          Mr. Duncombe said he had frequently
          seen Pitzel in company with Holmes
          and that ho would know whether ttie
          corpse in question waa the body of
          Pitzel if be aaw it.

          SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, JULY 16, 1895.
          BURIED IN A CELLAR
          Bodies of the Murdered
          Pietzel Girls Found
          in Toronto.
          THREE FIENDISH CRIMES.
          The Notorious H. H. Holmes
          Accused of Taking Their
          Lives.
          RECORD OF MANY KILLINGS.
          It Is Thought the Insurance Swin
          dler Had Murdered the Elder
          Pietzel.
          TORONTO, Ont., July 15.— The bodies
          of Etta, Alice and Hettie Pietzel, the miss
          ing daughters of Benjamin F. Pietzel,
          were found by Detective Cuddy of Toronto
          and Detective Greyer of Philadelphia, to
          day, buried in the cellar of the house
          No. 16 St. Vincent street. H. H. Holmes,
          now under arrest at Philadelphia, is be
          lieved to have deliberately murdered the
          girls after he had first murdered their
          father in Philadelphia and their brother in
          Detroit.
          Inquiries began by the police to-day and
          led to the knowledge that Holmes and the
          children lived at the house in question,
          and search was made by the two ottioers.
          A photograph of Holmes was shown to
          Frank N. Nudel of the Ontario Educational
          Department, who owns No. 16 St. Vincent
          street, and without hesitation he identified
          it as that of the man who had rented the
          house from him last October, and after a
          very short stay had departed.
          When they reached the cellar it appeared
          to the detectives that something had dis
          turbed the cellar floor, and arming them
          selves with shovels they began to dig. A
          short distance below the surface they came
          across the arm and a portion at the head of
          one of the girls, and further work soon re
          vealed the bodies of all of the victims.
          They were nude and apparently had lain
          there since last October.
          City Detective Inspector Stark was com
          municated with and gave instructions that
          the bodies be removed, and they were
          taken to Humphrey's undertaking estab
          lishment on Yonge street. Coroner Orr
          was informed of the ghastly discovery, and
          called an inquest to be held at Police
          Headquarters to-morrow night. It is un
          derstood that the jury will meet pro forma,
          and after viewing the bodies will adjourn
          for one week, to enable the Crown authori
          ties to work up evidence. The bodies of
          the little ones were buried three feet from
          the surface and were in a fair state of
          preservation.
          Holmes, the alleged murderer of the
          girls, is held in Philadelphia on a charge
          of conspiracy, and a nice legal point now
          presents itself. The murders have been
          committed in Canada, the accused
          must be tried within its boundaries, but
          as Holmes has pleaded guilty to one
          charge in the United States he may insist
          on being sentenced for that.
          H. H. Holmes, alias Harwam W. Mudg
          ett, alias H. H. Howard, was born in New
          Haven, Conn., and attended a medical
          school at Burlington, Vt.,and later at Ann
          Arbor, Mich. He was married at the
          latter place. He and a friend swindled an
          insurance company in Chicago om of
          $12,000 soon after graduating. They made
          another haul of $10,000 in a similar way.
          Holmes went into the drug business and
          speculated. His wife went home and he
          married another woman, with whom he
          went to California.
          Returning about a year ago, he went to
          housekeeping with the woman typewriter
          of the company, whose acquaintance he
          had formed. He tried to cheat a fire insur
          ance company out of $00,000, but failed,
          and learning that his typewriter and her
          sister had inherited $50,000 laid a scheme
          to ket the money. The sister came to live
          with them and suddenly disappeared,
          while he and Minnie, the typewriter girl,
          took up their abode at the Plaza Hotel,
          Chicago.
          Holmes next appeared in Terre Haute,
          Ind., where he bailed Pietzel out of jail.
          From there he went to Franklin, Ind.,
          where he married Miss Yoke, and they
          spent their honeymoon in Denver, where
          Holmes made $27,000 in speculation.
          At Philadelphia, later on, he and Fietzel
          played the last card. Pietzel wu insured
          in the Philadelphia Mutual for $10,000.
          On September 3 he was found dead in the
          house at 1316 Callowhill street, which he
          had rented under the name of B. F. Perry.
          His body was badly burned and the face
          was almost unrecognizable. Holmes and
          Pietzel's wife's children identified the body
          as Pietzel's, and $7500 of the insurance was
          paid over.
          Then Train-robber Hedgespeth gave the
          whole case away to Chief of Police Harri
          son because Lawyer Howe, whom he had
          got into the conspiracy, had not paid
          him the promised reward. Holmes was
          traced to Toronto, Burlington and Boston,
          and in the latter city was arrested. Mean
          while the Pietzel children haa disappeared,
          the boy being traced to Indianapolis and
          two girls to Toronto. Holmes awaits
          sentence in Philadelphia for insurance
          fraud, and the police expect to fix several
          murders on him.
          Doctors who have examined the bodies
          agree with Detective Grier's theory that
          the girls were killed by hypodermic injec
          tions of morphine. Holmes is known to
          be an expert user of injections. J

          PHILADELPHIA, Pa., July With
          the finding of the bodies of the Pietzel
          children in Toronto, a chapter in the his
          tory of one of the most sensational crim
          inal cases in the annals of this country is
          closed, and the net of the law is being
          drawn more closely " about one of
          the : boldest scoundrels . who have ever
          been arraigned at the bar of justice.
          Herman Mudgett. alias H. H. Holmes, is
          in the County Prison here awaiting sen
          tence to the confessed charge of conspiracy
          in defrauding the Fidelity Life Association
          of Philadelphia. out of $10,000 by palm
          ing off upon it a bogus body
          as that of Benjamin F. Pietzel, , a
          policy-holder of the company. The case
          exceeds in interest the most sensational
          novel ever written, and has so many sides
          to it that it ts difficult to even outline it in
          the ordinary length of a newspaper dis
          patch. ■;:
          ■ In July, 1889, tne Fidelity Life Associa
          tion issued a policy for $10,000 upon the
          life of Benjamin Pietzel. Shortly after
          this, a man giving the name of B. A.
          Perry rented a house at 1319 Cailowhill
          street, this city. In September of the
          same year a lire, shown to have been
          caused by an explosion, occurred at the
          house and the charred body of Perry was
          found.
          A short time after this Jephtha B.Howe,
          an attorney at St. Louis, presented a claim
          to the Fidelity Company for the $10,000 on
          the life of Pietzel, alleging that the man
          found in the house at 1319 Callow
          hill was Pietzel. With Howe were
          Alice, the 13-year-old daughter of Pietzel,
          and Holmes, the arch conspirator in the
          case. The body of the supposed Perry had
          beenburied in the potter's field, but was ex
          humed, and Alice and Holmes positively
          identified it as that of Pietzel. The money
          was paid to Howe and the party returned
          to St. Louis.
          Mrs. Pieteel was in St. Louis at this
          tini-', and through the representations of
          Holmes that she could aid her husband in
          furthering his interests, had consented to
          become a party to Holmes' scheme to de
          ceive the insurance company by passing
          off upon it a bogus body as that of Pietzel.
          Holmes told her that he and Pietzel had
          procured a corpse in New York and had
          had it up in the house at 1319 Cailowhill
          street and that this was the body found.
          Mrs. Pietzel believed this story, and to aid
          her husband consented to take part in the
          deception.
          The insurance company became sus
          picious, and setting detectives upon
          Holmes' track built up a case against him,
          and in November last year Holmes was
          arrested in Boston.
          A few days after Holmes' arrest Mrs.
          Pietzel was arrested in the same city and
          Howe was arrested in St. Louis. Holmes
          offered to relieve her of the burden
          of the three children. The oldest and
          the youngest child remained with Mrs.
          Pietzel and Holmes took the other three.
          Alice, Nettie and Howard. After parting
          with her children, Mrs. Pietzel has never
          been able to obtain from Holmes any defi
          nite Knowledge of their whereabouts.

          CHICAGO, July 27. — More con
          clusive evidence than has heretofore
          been collected by the police in the
          Holmes case was revealed by the
          investigation tonight. Inspector
          Fitzpatrick believes it to be certain
          that at least three murders were
          committed in the "castle" of Holmes,
          and through witnesses that were
          found today it is believed Holmes
          can now be convicted of murder in
          this city. The police have found a
          man, whose name they refuse to di
          vulge, but who was brought to the
          office of the inspector this afternoon
          by Lieut. Thomas and Officer Foley,
          of the Cottage Grove avenue sta
          tion. He told the police that he had
          mounted three skeletons for Holmes,
          and that the skeletons were from
          bodies taken from the house of
          Holmes on Sixty-third street. One
          of these he said was the body of a
          man, and the other two were wom
          en. They were taken from a dark
          room in Holmes' house in the night
          time, and two of the mounted skel
          etons were returned to Holmes. The
          flesh of the bodies had not been
          stripped from the bones when the
          bodies were given to the new wit
          ness, but the faces were so badly
          lacerated and torn that identifica
          tion would have been impossible.
          The police also found an expressman
          today who was able to give what the
          police think is important informa
          tion. The name of the expressman
          is Charles Humphrey, and in the
          month of June, 1893, he was hired
          by Holmes to deliver a box and a
          trunk at the union depot in this
          city. The box, according to Humph
          rey, was taken from a dark room
          and had the appearance of a coffin
          box. This was expressed to Phila
          delphia, while the trunk was sent
          in another direction.
          GHASTLY DETAILS.
          The story of the man who mount
          ed the skeletons is to the effect that
          in June, 1593, he was sent for by
          Holmes, who at that time was go
          ing under the alias of Gordon, and
          asked if he would articulate the
          skeleton of a man whose body was
          in the possession of Holmes. He ac
          cepted the job, and by the direction
          of Holmes he called at the house on ;
          a stipulated night. He was taken !
          by Holmes to a room which would
          have been dark even in the day
          time. Stretched out on a table in
          the middle of the room was the body
          of a man. The skin was entirely re
          moved from the face, but in all other
          respects it .*■ was in good condition.
          The articulator and Holmes had
          some talk as to the best way of get
          ting the body out of the house, as
          Holmes said he did not want the
          neighbors to see it removed. It was
          finally agreed that the articulator
          should cut off the, arms, and that
          Holmes would provide for the re- '
          moval of the rest of the ■. corpse, j
          This was done, and the articulator I
          left the house carrying the arms ;
          with him in a sack. He had just
          reached his house, and was prepar
          ing to go to bed, when ,he was
          called to the front door by a loud
          knocking. He went down and
          found Holmes and another man
          there. They had the balance of the
          body, which had been cut into two
          more pieces after, the articulator
          left the house. Holmes left, after !
          remarking that he would have an-
          VALKYRIE 111. ' '--•- DEFENDER; .r'*~ -.'..-* -. v» ■■'■■_ I
          other job for the man in a short
          time. True to his word, in Decem
          ber he sent for the articulator a sec
          ond time, and on the arrival of the
          latter at the house of Holmes he
          was taken to the same dark room,
          where en the same table where the
          body of a man had 'lain on the oc
          casion of his former visit, was the
          body of a young woman. The face
          of this corpse had been disfigured
          in such a manner that it was im
          possible to tell what she had looked
          like when alive. Y^YYY.Y
          The story of the expressman is to
          ST. PAUL, MINN., SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 28, 1895.---SIXTEEN PAGES.
          I the effect that he was hired by r
          Holmes one afternoon, and told not ;
          ito come to the house until after
          i nightfall. When the expressman
          ! kept his appointment he was given
          a box and a trunk by Holmes and i
          told to take them to the union depot. i
          When he was putting the box into
          the wagon he turned it on end, and i
          I was at once stopped by Holmes, who j
          told him that he was on no account i
          to keep the box in any other posi- I
          j tion except flat on the side. The or- i
          ders were to take the trunk and box I
          • to the depot and leave them on I
          the platform, and he was told that j
          they would be taken care of. He !
          saw only one man at the depot who
          seemed to be interested in the trunk I
          and the box. After Humphrey had
          told his story to the police tonight, j
          Pat Quinlan was brought up from j
          his cell and the two were placed
          face to face. The police will not j
          tell why this was done, but the
          general opinion is that it was done
          because Humphrey recognized Quin
          lan as the man at the depot. The
          expressman will be retained in cus
          ! tody as a witness.
          HIS THIRD TRIP.
          J In January, 1893, the articulator was
          I sent for a third time by Holmes, and in
          i the same room and on the same table
          j he found the body of a second young
          i woman, from whose face all the skin
          j had been removed. The articulator
          ! had this body taken to his home, where
          j he stopped the bones and mounted the
          i skelton. When he called on Holmes
          i for his pay the latter refused to give it
          i to him, and was, moreover, somewhat
          J in arrears on the bill for mounting the
          two previous skeltons. The two men
          could not come to terms and the dis
          pute finally ended by the articulator
          j retaining possession of the third skel
          ton, and he still has it it in his house.
          j He removed the skull tonight and
          brought it to the central police station,
          I where It now Is. The articulator will
          be kept under close surveillance for
          j some days yet, as the police do not
          I think that he has told them all he
          I knows about the murder in the "cas-
          I tie." He said at first that Holmes
          j called at his house under the name of
          i Gordon, and later said that he be
          j came acquainted with Holmes through I
          j answering an advertisement for a man j
          I capable In the work of articulating
          j skeletons, and found that the advertise-
          S ment had been inserted by Holmes,
          j Afterwards he let drop some expres
          , sions that showed that he had done
          j some work for Holmes prior to the time j
          ' that he claimed his acquaintance with
          i him began. This discrepancy in his
          j story decided the police to keep a close
          . watch on him. The police declare that
          ! they have almost positive proof that
          J the first female body was that of
          I Emeline Cigrand and the second that of
          Annie Williams. It is the skull of
          . Annie Williams that is now at the
          central police station.
          J BURIED IN QUICKLIME.
          In prosecuting the investigation of
          j the basement of the big brick house on
          j Sixty-third street today the workmen
          employed by the police came upon two
          graves. The indications are that in
          | the graves were laid the bodies of Mm
          J nic and Annie Williams. Lime and
          j quicklime had accomplished their work
          j and the bodies had turned to native |
          dust, but there still remained sufficient
          evidence to make the indentificati.on
          possible. Two soft spots in a bed of |
          hard clay were the size of human bod- j
          ies, and where the heads would have I
          been were mats of long hair. One big
          strand was of light color, like that of
          Annie, while the other was of the'
          brown hue of Minnie's hair. '
          The juxtaposition of the mats of
          hair would indicate that the bodies
          had been laid side by side, the heads
          but a few inches apart. Twelve men I
          worked with picks and shovels in the !
          I rear basement of the "castle" today. '
          ) They were divided into two squads, i
          j One squad worked under the the tin i
          j shop and the other attacked the dirt |
          j bottom of the. cellar, near the rear and I
          I west walls. It was clcse to the parti- .
          | tion between the rear and front cellars,
          j under the stairs leading from the tin (
          I shop, that early in the afternoon the j
          i two masses of quicklime were found.
          I Two bones and masses of hair were
          found in them. A long, wooden, shal- '
          j low vat was found two feet under the i
          ground. It was expected that when j
          cleared out evidences that a human I
          body had been buried there would be !
          found but the examination resulted
          i in nothing of the kind. Either it was
          a blind sewer or a secret repository.
          A LETTER TO PAT.
          The police have found a letter from
          . Holmes to Pat Quinlan, to which much
          importance is attached. The letter is
          j as follows:
          Dear Pat: Among ether fool theor

          MURDER OF JULIA CONNOR.
          Asphyxiated, Cut Up and Cremat
          ed hy Holmes.
          CHICAGO, July 27.-Mrs. Patrick
          Quinlan lost her defiant spirit in the
          police inquisition. Two days' "sweat-
          DOX experience proved more than she
          £m I»v.beai;1 »v. beai ;. wit equanimity, and she
          told the police things which before had
          not been acknowledged. Chief of Po
          lice Badenoch said: Evidence secured
          from Mrs. Quinlan is highly important,
          fahe confessed to abetting Holmes in
          insurance swindles, and that is a step
          in the right direction. Patrick Quin
          lan, her husband, continues to protest
          he was a mere hireling, and roes not
          know Holmes' affairs at all. Mrs. Quin
          lan s evidence was that, after Mrs.
          Connor s disappearance it became nec
          essary for Holmes to produce her to
          collect some insurance. Mrs. Quinlan
          consented to act in her place. She
          went to the insurance office and swore
          she was Mrs. Connor, and signed that
          name. According to the statements of
          Jonathan Belmont it was Christmas
          night, four years and six months ago,
          that Mrs. Connor was killed.
          He believes she was asphyxiated in
          her room while she slept. Her room
          was a small one adjoining the dark
          ! bath room in the "castle." When all
          was still in the house Holmes switched
          on the gas. When the deed was ac
          complished Holmes stealthily admitted
          himself through- the secret door of the
          bath room, lifted the inanimate form
          ol Mrs. Connor from the bed, and car
          ried it to the bath room. Then, placing
          the body in the bath tub, he proceeded
          to cut It to pieces, and fed them to a
          hot fire in the stove. When all was
          done he took the ashes and parts of
          the body that had not been entirely
          burned and buried them in lime in the
          cellar. ■_._,.■..
          The police believe the chain of evi
          dence against Pat Quinlan now com
          plete, and Holmes' ex-janitor will be
          tried for murder here.
          A HISSING BROTHER.
          "Horace Williams Disappeared Be
          fore His Sisters Were Rilled.
          CHICAGO, July 27.— William Capps.
          the Fort Worth, Texas, attorney who
          is here in behalf of the heirs of the'
          Williams sisters, advanced a rather
          startling theory today, which if found
          to be true, will add another victim
          to the long list of murders already
          credited to Holmes. According- to
          Capps, Minnie R. Williams ' had a
          brother named Horace A. Williams in j
          Denver, Col. This young man either 1
          was killed or disappeared ' in May .or
          June, ISS3, shortly before the supposed
          murder of the Williams .sisters. The
          manner of his death iSjiiot known to
          the attorney, but he says he has ascer
          tained that the young man was insured '
          for $2,500 in favor of his sister Minnie.
          This fact Mr. Capps considers to be
          decidedly peculiar, as he says it is not
          reasonable to suppose Horace Williams
          would insure his life in favor of a sis
          ter who was already wealthy. He said
          that his Investigations upon this point
          were in an uncompleted state, but
          from what he had learned he was of the
          opinion that Holmes had first insured
          the young man and then been instru
          mental In causing his death.

          Enieline Cigrscd.
          Chicago, III., Aug. 2. The police have
          at last obtained a partial confession
          from Pat Quinlan, the janitor of the
          Holmes "castle" and have, they be
          lieve, positive evidence that Benjamin
          F. Pietzel was murdered in this city by
          Holmes and the corpse sent to Phila
          delphia. The confession was wormed out of
          Quinlan by means of a tip given the
          local officers by Detective Geyer of
          Philadelphia, who arrived in this city
          today. The exact nature of the story
          told by Quinlan the police will not re
          veal and in fact Chief Badenoch and
          Inspector Fitzpatrick have both denied
          that Quinlan or his wife made any con
          fession at all. Notwithstanding the
          denial of the police, however, it is posi
          tively known that Quinlan made a
          signed confession because it was left
          where Quinlan's signature on the docu
          ment could be seen, although the sub
          ject matter under which he wrote his
          name .could not be ascertained. Tonight
          however, it was learned that a confes
          sion was made covering all the detils
          of the murder of Pietzl with the ex
          ception of the actual place in which
          the crime was committed.
          This the police declare they will have
          tomorrow and they declare that by sun
          set of Aug. 5, they will have undisput
          able evidence that Pietzel came to his
          end through the direct agency of II. II.
          Holmes. The confession was obtained
          from the Quinlans only after the hard
          est kind of work, and at the price of a
          promise of immunity from punishment
          for all the part the Quinlan's may have
          borne in the murder of Pietzel or other
          crimes committed by Holmes.
          MINNIE WILLIAMS LIVES.
          Little Rock, Aug. 2. Attorney O. M.
          Humphreys of Fort Worth arrived here
          today and went almost imemdiately to
          the prison where he and Superintend
          ent McConnell were closeted for some
          time with Convinct Allen. Mr. Hum
          phreys represents the interests holding
          claims against Minnie Wiliam's prop
          erty in Fort Worth on debts contract
          ed by Holmes and his accomplices.
          After the conference he sead:
          "Undoubtedly Allen knows more than
          anybody else about the transfer of the
          Williams property because he spoke to
          me intelligently about the various pa
          pers conected with the deal which are
          now In my possession and the contents
          of which have never been made public.
          I knew Allen in Fort Worth and from
          circumstances as yet unpublished which
          he mentioned to me today, in connec
          tion with those deals. I know he was
          intimate with Holme"."
          "Do you think Minnie Williams is
          still alive?"
          "I most assuredly do. From what I
          know and from what Allen said today,
          I am positive that she is not only liv
          ing but that she is in the United States
          and that were Holmes free he would be
          with her in less than forty-eight hours."
          WHAT MRS. QUINLAN KNOWS.
          Mrs. Pat Quinlan knew of the disap
          pearance of Mrs. Julia L. Conner in
          Holmes' castle and saw the body of
          the woman after she was elead. She
          further knew and has admitted that
          Pearl Conner disappeared mysterious
          ly in the castle after her return from
          a trip to the Quinlan farm at Lake
          Michigan.
          Chief Badenoch took Mrs. Quinlan
          and her husband to the castle today
          with Inspector Fitzpatrick and detec
          tives Fitzpatrick and Norton. The ob
          ject of this trip was more for the pur
          pose of letting Quinlan and his wife
          meet than any other. They were clos
          eted together alone for an hour in the
          room in which the Julia Conner's car
          pet lies and the chair belonging to the
          murdered woman stands. What took
          place between them no one knows but
          Chief Badenoch and his detectives. The
          chief now has proof positive that Mrs.
          Connor and Pearl, her daughter, or Co
          ra Quinlan, were murdered in the main
          building while the mother was in
          Holmes' employe. Quinlan has given
          information within the last twenty-four
          hours which brings the charge of mur
          der nearer to Holmes than it has been
          in Chicago at any time since the case
          opened. Quinlan and his wife while
          demonstrating to the police that they
          were at no time guilty of the crime of
          murder themselves have made admis
          sions by which the chief could use
          them on the stand as valuable witness
          es against Holmes in proving that Mrs.
          Conner anil a child were made away
          with by Holmes for the purpose of se
          curing insurance which Mrs. Cononr
          carried on her life in favor of her
          daughter or in which Cora Quinlan
          cut an important figure.
          Further, Quinlan and his wife have
          proved to the police that Mrs. Con
          nor was so Avell aware of the schemes
          which Holmes were operating that it
          became necessary for Holmes to put
          the woman out of the way.
          Mrs. Connor's bo lv was disposed of
          by burial within tne castle somewhere
          close to tfie spot where Pearl's sup
          posed body was found. The police have
          not ceased their effort" to flnd the bot
          tom of the basement and uncover her
          remains. The digging which was sus
          pended today will continue tomorrow
          and during the coming week. Pat Quin
          Ian and his wife have admitted parti
          ally, the woman more than the man.
          that a business in receiving and dis
          posing of dead bodies stolen from
          country graveyards was carried on in
          the castle under tli direction of
          Holmes. The graveyards of the west
          ern portion of Michigan. Grand Haven
          South Haven. Muskeg.-.n.. Holland. St.
          Joseph. The Bay. Laka. all ancient
          places, with venerable graves were de-sp-Mled
          of bodies.
          The bodies were brought to the cas
          tle, chemically treated ani thn dis
          posed of to medfeal colleges The cof
          fins were re-made by Quinlan. Pietael
          and Holmes, reliaed and disposed of to
          undertakers at a fair profit.
          We have suOlcSent evidence to keep
          Holmes In prion for t he remainder of t
          his natural days" said Detective Geyer
          toiay. "wicnout cnarjnng- nim with
          murder. Should he. by technicalitv.
          escape the conspiracy charge in Phila
          delphia, twenty worrants oa other char
          ges are ready to 'be served on hca. The
          Toronto charge of murder is the stron
          gest one acalnst hira and if he is tak
          en there he will probably be hanged
          As to all the Chicago charges there is
          only proof that he was a swindler. I
          believe it will be finally shown that
          he did murder Mrs. Conner and the
          two Williams girls. M'nnie Williams
          J think, was killed last fall at the same
          time as Howard Pletsel."

          1S91-93 and where the "packages" he
          handled were delivered.
          The new witness said he did not
          know what these packages contained
          at the time they were handled. To the
          police he made no reservations but
          since Chappell says his traffic was in
          dead men's bones Richardson says he
          is quite prepared to believe it. The num
          ber of these trips to the Wallace street
          house he adds cannot be contained In
          twenty calls, nor thirty.
          "X remember this special package
          very well," said Richardson. "Holmes
          sent these boxes all over the city at
          times to physicians and medical stu
          dents and again to the hospitals direct
          A good part of the stuff was also taken
          to the various depots. He received a
          good many consignments himsplf from
          other points. The boxes handled as I
          remember them were strong and ticht
          C-nd there were also well headed barrels
          in numbers. I don't remember of see
          ing that old trunk Chappell turned up
          r.or do I recall any trips to dump stuff
          in the lake. I guess Holmes had use
          for most everything he handled with
          out throwing anything away."

          Memphis, Tenn., Aug. 2. The Little
          Rock end of the Holmes murder sen
          sation is about petered out. In the next
          forty-eight hours the police will in all
          probability, have proen tha Convict
          John Caldwell could have had no con
          nection with Holmes and his crimes, as
          he was in the Tennessee penitentiary
          for horse stealing at the time he claims
          to have been operating in Fort Worth
          Tex., for Holmes. A few months ago
          he was pordoned but went Immediate
          ly to Arkansas and engnged in his for
          mer pursuit. There he again came to
          grief and was sent to the Arkansas
          state prison where he now is. The
          Memphis police are confident Caldwell's
          story is only a ruse to get out of prison.
          WANTS PAY FOR TALK.
          Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 2. "Two
          hundred dollars, sir." is the cash value
          placed by C. W. Arnold, the insurance
          agent, on his knowledge of the career
          of Holmes. Nevertheless for the last
          two days Arnold has been a constant at
          tendant at the newspaper offices here
          and has been interviewed to his heart's
          content.
          Arnold was asked point blank today
          as to his holding shares in the com
          panies organized by Holmes for vari
          ous purposes. If you like to pay me
          $200 I will write out what I know and
          hand It to you and the Minneapolis pa
          pers shall publish it at the same time.
          I will dictate it myself to a stenograph
          er, but I tell you before hand I do not
          think it worth a cent to you, as I had
          no knowledge of any crimes. Holmes
          used my name In those companies with
          out my knowledge or authority. In the
          same breath he added: "I never invest
          ed a cent in any of his companies and
          certainly had no knowledge of any of
          his swindling operations. I never went
          up stairs in the house or building. I
          never saw a stenographer or typewriter
          there. There was no handsome blonde
          typewriter there so far as I saw. I
          knew nothing of his vats or furnaces. I
          never sats them. I never saw, met, or
          knew Kmlllne Cigrand, Mrs. Connor,
          or her daughter, Mrs. Lee, Minle Will
          iams or her sister, nor Emily von Tas
          sel. I never insured any of those peo
          ple for Holmes or at Holmes sugges
          tion. All I can say is as to my person
          al dealings with and friendship for Mr.
          Holmes, and I am out for the stuff and
          intend to get it before I say anything.
          Two hundred dollars Is my price. You
          put up the money and I will write you
          a story of a dozen of extraordinary
          facts about Holmes, but I won't talk
          to reporters I am busyv There Is a
          good market for this kind of stuff. Why
          several novelists have already approac
          hed me and offered me large sums to
          tell what I know of Holmes for publi
          cation in book form. I am wanting the
          money and can use it In my business,
          nnd I shall not talk, I tell you, until I
          get it."
          Then Mr. Arnold, who had done most
          of the talking, waited for questions
          with the sang froid of an experienced
          politician. He was atked as to insur
          ances effected by him for Holmes or at
          Holmes' instigation and claimed that
          he insured Holmes by three separate
          policies for $5,000 each, which policies
          Holmes neglected to pay for or take up.
          Arnold admits insuring Pietzel for 2000
          but claims that this policy lapsed and
          long before Pietzel met his end. When
          asked for particulars as to insurance
          companies for whom he worked in Chi
          cago, Arnold denied positively having
          worked for the Mutual Life of Philadel
          phia, the Northwestern or the Vermont
          and in the same breath refused to say
          what companies he worked for.
          When questioned closely as to his
          dealingswith Holmes he claimed that
          his acquaintance was purely a passing
          friendship, though he might have act
          ed as witness to various legal docu
          ments. As to the nature of these he
          essayed to be very mysterious and he
          point blank asked for pecuniary com
          pensation for divulging. He absolute
          ly denies that he was out from 11 p m.
          until 3 a. m. on any occasion attting
          legal documents for Holmes ar. I cut
          short the conversation bv sa ing be
          would talk no more until S200 was forth
          coming for his information.
          SPIRITS ARE INVOKED.
          Anderson, Ind., Aug. 2. The friends
          of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Cigrand, whose
          daughter Emeline is believed to have
          been one of H. H. Holmes' victims, are
          much interested in the attempt by
          spiritualist seances to communicate
          with the spirit of Emeline. A number
          of people have had private sittings with
          mediums, but a they report no satis
          faction a woman whose name must be
          withheld went into a seance for the
          spirit of EmeJine.
          After sitting in a dark room for near
          ly two hours she ays there was a voice
          in the trumpet and she understood it to
          say:
          "This is Emma. I went into the spirit
          land two years ago and was far from
          home. O, it was so horrible." Here the
          words became whispers and were not
          audible. Suddenly another voice said:
          "I hope sister will soon join me. I
          have something awful to tell her. My
          husband is stil beyond the spirit land.
          I send love to mamma and papa, and
          tell the to " and here the spirit stop-
          ped and could not be called again.
          Mrs. Bibbeth Seery. one of the best
          of Indiana mediums, was sen at her
          home in Muncie tonight. Sho would
          not attempt to call up the spirit of
          Emeline Cigrand, for she said it was
          absurd.
          "The laws of aature are the govern
          ment r all mediums and spirit." said
          the medium. "The dead girl would have
          to be well known to any one speaking (
          who saould have talked with the girl
          in worldly life shortly before death. I
          Natural resources are arainst nie. for I
          saould one spirit be called and told to
          hont for the spirit of the girl it would
          not know the spirit. Should she- call !
          circumstances attending her death a
          reported it would affect the spiritual
          condition "
          A trance medium attempted to talk
          with the girl's spirit. He asuaied a
          trance state and speaking for a spirit
          EAld- ,
          "All seems dark; ao Hgnt asywhre: j
          come, come quick: I eaanot be here
          locg. O, had I known this. J
          Here the medium came out of the !
          trance. He promised to make aaother j

          Tort Townsend, Wash., Oct. 28. The
          Mount Olympas' Volcano exploring party
          returned last evening from a five days'
          trip Into the"beartbf that range.
          They report that while the outburst Is
          not a regular volc'ano, there Is good
          grounds for the Impression that a Tierce
          subterranean conflagration is in progress.
          Tlle'cxarhTriatioii'made by the party was
          necessarily circumspect, owing to the in
          tense heat and stifling smoke, but from
          wliatcouid be discovered the explorers have
          concluded that the puffs of smoke alter
          nating with flashes of fire which were
          plainly visible from here resulted from
          the" consumption fir 'a huge vein of lignite
          coal, the outtroppings of which have often
          been reported.
          The de ep gorges had in lime become filled
          with an impregnable mass of fallen trees
          and 'among these the fire had in some way
          started and from this intense heal the
          lignite vein 'was Ignited.
          The perpetual snow, which In years
          past 'crowned the peak, has melted away
          and the rivulets pouring upon the see'hing

          elastic at Chicago.
          STORY OP THH ARREST.
          Benjamin F. Piterel's liody was round In
          a house at 131C Callow hill street 011 Sep
          tember 3, 1894. A shattered lamp was
          found by the side of -the body wliUh bore
          evidence of having iie-en turned, and the
          coroner's Jury concluded ttiat tlie oil lamp
          had exploded and that Pilczcl, who was
          at the time known as M. F. Perry, had been
          burned to deutti. and accordingly rendered
          a vcntUt or accidental death.
          There was no claimant ror the body and
          it was buried in Potter's field. Subse
          quently an assertion came iroin Mrs. Fltc
          zel's lawyer at St. Louis, Mr. Jeplha
          Uowe, that the body w.u that of Benjamin
          F. Pltezei, and a claim was made ou the
          Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Phil
          adelphia for $10,000, which that cotu
          pauy carries! on Pitezel's life.
          Tlie insurance company paid the claim,
          but not Is'iiig satisfied tti.it Pllc-zel had
          niet his el am accidentally, at once placed
          delective3 on the case to solve the mys
          tery. This rcsu'ltesl in tlie arrest in Bos
          ton or Mudgett, alias Holmes.
          The lane, was opu.uc. lure and vas
          placed 011 trial charged with conspiracy to
          defraud the insurance company. Holmes
          pleaded guilty to Ihjs charge, but to cum
          bat tlie more serious ciiarge of inurdtr
          claimed that Pilczcl is still litiiig: that a
          body was ohtaine-d from a Ner Vork dls
          sesting room arsljilactsl in the building on
          Callowhili strct. alter burning the skin
          sllghtlv and throning a lamp 011 the floor.
          Holmes (laiincd that he .mil Pltezei lelt
          the city and suhseeiui ntly informed Mrs.
          Pitezel that the body was that or her
          missing husband and had her press her
          claim for the insurance.
          GKYKU'S DISCOVERIES.
          Holmes was sent to prison to await sen
          tence on tlie conspiracy trial, anil District
          Attorney Graham startesl Ilctcctlte Gcyer
          out to v lslt Toronto, Chicago and other
          Western cities, to endeavor to obtain ci
          dence against Holmes which would warrant
          his being arruigucs! for murder.

          dead bodies or Ihe children Is well I. noun,
          and otlur rails which he gleanesl sallsricd
          District Attorney Graham that Holmes could
          be comlcied here o.the murder of Pltezei.
          Detective GPyer also brought to this city
          Mrs. Pltezei anil others from various parts
          or tlie Wist and Canada lo take the stand
          as wltnisssMS against Holmes.
          The approaches to the court room were
          closely guarded, and Hone but jicrsons di
          rectly intcre-sted in the caso.and newspaper
          men, were admitted. The case was called
          shortly after 10 o'clock.
          Holmes walked Jauntily into tlie dock,
          a tipstaff being on cither side of him. He
          was rather pale from long conrincment in
          tlie county prison, but his black beard was
          neatly trimmed, and his black suit of
          clothing gave him adressy appearance.
          Tlie accused took his sent with a calmness
          that was noticeable, and whlleheetlnceda
          decided interest in the matters at issue,
          there was no look of fear upon Ms counto
          nance nor any evidence of nervousness in
          his action.
          SENSATIONAL EPISODE.
          , Judge Arnold overruled the motions for
          postponement in a very few words, and
          ordered the trial to go on. Just at this
          Juncture a startling climax was reached,
          which resulted in the withdrawal of Law
          yers Shoemaker and Rotan from the case,
          notwithstanding an injunction from tho
          court that they would be open to disbar
          ment by taking such a step "ou the eveof a
          murder trial."
          Stili further sensation was created wiien
          Holmes refused to accept the services of
          Attorney! Everett A. Sehofield and Joseph.
          R. Fahy, whom the court was about to ap
          point to -defend him and who, lu fact, had
          taken "scats in the hairs vacated by Messrs.
          Shoemaker and Rotan.
          Sehorieldaud Fahy also withdrew. Holmes
          himself pleaded to the court for a post
          ponement, but the Judge declared that
          tho case must go on. The trial was re
          sumed, Holmes conducting his own defense.

          HANGED FOR
          MANY CRIMES,
          Murderer Holmes' Career
          Comes to an End on
          the Gallows.
          STUBBORN TO THE LAST
          He Died as if Entirely In
          different to His Awiul
          Fate.
          DECLARING HIS INNOCENCE.
          The Execution Passed Off Without
          Any Incidents of a Sensa
          tional Nature.
          PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 7.—Her
          man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes,
          was hanged this" mornine in the County
          Prison for tne killing of Benjamin F.
          Pietzel.
          The drop fellatlO:l2o'cloctc, and twenty
          minutes later he was pronounced dead by
          the prison officials, Dr. Sharp and Dr.
          Batcher.
          The execntion was in every way entirely
          devoid of any sensational features.
          To the last Holmes was self-possessed
          and cool, even to the extent of giving a
          word of advice to Assistant Superintend
          ent Richardson as the latter -was arrang
          ing the final details. He died as ne had
          lived, unconcerned and thoughtless, ap
          parently, of the future, even with the rec
          ollection still vividly before him of the
          H. H. Holmes, alias Mudgett, the Arch Criminal of Modern History. Who Was
          Hanged Yesterday.
          recent confession in which he admitted
          the killing of a score of persons of both
          sexes in different parts of the country.
          Almost his last words were a point-blank
          denial of any crimes committed except the
          deaths of two women at his hands by mal
          practice.
          Of the murder of several members of tbe
          Pietzel family he denied all complicity,
          particularly of the father, for whose death
          he stated he was unjustly suffering the
          penalty. With the prayer of the spiritual
          attendants still sounding in his ears and
          with a few low-spoken words to those
          about him tbe trap was sprang.
          There were comparatively few persons
          gathered on the outside of the prison dur
          ing the eariy part of the morning and the
          morbid throng which the prison officials
          expected would be drawn there by the
          execution was lacking. Access to the
          prison prior to the entrance of those per
          mitted to witness the execution was not
          allowed.
          All the arrangements for the burial of
          Holmes were entrusted by the murderer
          to Mr. Rotan. The place of interment has,
          it is understood, been selected, but those
          who are most likely to know where the
          grave is to be will not divulge the iov-a
          tion.
          Holmes retired about midnight and
          slept soundly during the entire time until
          called at 6 o'clock this morning. So sound
          were his slumbers, in fact, that twice was
          he called before awauening. When the
          arrival of the Rev. Fathers Dailey and Me-
          Pake to administer the sacrament was an
          nounced he greeted them warmly, but
          witii no show of emotion. For nearly two
          hours they remained in the cell and then
          were succeeded by Lawyer Rotan, the le
          gal adviser of Holmes, who was also
          greeted pleasantly. There were several
          matters pertaining to Holmes' worldly af
          fairs that will yet have to be settled and
          this time was taken in giving the final de
          tails and explanations. While discussing
          his affairs breakfast was served, consisting
          of eggs, toast and coffee.
          When the raeal was ended, shortly be
          fore 9 o'clock, Holmes dressed himself in
          trousers, vest and cutaway coat of some
          dark mixed goods of a pepper and salt ef
          fect he aad worn frequently.
          At 10 o'clocK the doors leading to the
          long corridor in which was placed the
          gallows were opened and, two by two, led
          by the Sheriff's jury, the spectators
          passea down. The last man had just
          passed through the doors and the latter
          closed when from behind was heard the
          slow and measured tread of the death
          party.
          The suspense was almost painful, brief
          though it was, when, preceded by Sheriff
          Clements and Superintendent Perkins,
          Holmes appeared and stepped on the trap.
          On the right was Father Dailey, to the
          left Fat; er McPake, and behind them
          Lawyer Rotan and Assistant Superin
          tendent Richardson. The little party
          stood a moment looking down, and then,
          in response to a signal from one of those
          beside him, Holmes stepped forward. He
          spoke slowly and with measured attention
          to every word— a trifle low at first, but
          louder as he proceeded, until every woid
          was distinctly audible.
          "Gentlemen," he said, "I have very few
          words to say, in fact, I would make no
          statemeut at this time, except that by not
          speaking I may be made to acquiesce in
          my execution. I only want to say that
          the extent of my wrongdoings in the
          taking of human life consisted in the
          death of two women, they having died at
          my hands as the result of criminal opera
          tions. I wish to state also, however, so that
          there will be no misunderstanding here
          after, tnat I am not guilty of taking the
          lives of any of the Pietzel family, the three
          children or the father, Benjamin F. Piet
          zel, of whose death I am now convicted,
          and for which I am to-day to be hanged.
          That is all."
          As he ceased speaking he stepped back,
          and kneeling between Fathers Dailey and
          McPake, he joined with them in silent
          prayer for a minute or two. Again stand
          ing he sbook hands with all about him
          and then signified his readiness for the
          end. Holmes was the coolest of the wuole
          yiarty. He even went to the extreme of
          suggesting to Assistant Superintendent
          Richardson that the latter should not
          hurry himself.
          "Take your time; don't bungle it,"
          Holmes remarked as the official exhibited
          some little haste, the outcome of nervous
          ness. These were almost his last words.
          The cap was adjusted, a low-toned query,
          "Are you ready?" and an equally low
          toned response, "Yes, good-by," and the
          trap was sprung.
          Holmes' neck was not broken, and there
          were a few convulsive twitches of the
          limbs that continued for about ten min
          utes. "But he suffered none after the
          drop," said Dr. Scott, the prison physi
          cian.
          The trap was sprung precisely at ]0:12)£,
          and fifteen minutes later Holmes was pro
          nounced dead, though the body was not
          cut down until 10:45. When ii was laid
          out on the stretcher occurred the only in
          cident approaching the revolting in con
          nection with the affair.
          The knot bad become jammed and the
          efforts of the doctors failed to loosen it as
          they attempted to remove the noose from
          about the neck. The head was twisted
          about from side to side in the attempt, and
          finally it was decided to cut the rope.
          Superintendent Perkins objected, however,
          and the knot was undone after several
          minutes of trying work.
          After the body had been viewed by the
          physicians and the manner of death dt
          termined the stretcher on whicn it lay was
          wheeled out of the corridor into the jail
          yard. Hero it was placed in an ordinary
          cheap pine coffin, wide enough and deep
          enough to have held two men of Holmes'
          size. The coffin was put aboard an under
          taker's wagon and conveyed to the Roman
          Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Cross.
          The only persons at the cemetery were
          the undertaker and his assistant, two
          grave-diggers, two watchmen and a couple
          of newspaper men. The little company
          acted as pallbearers, and carried the coffin
          to the receiving vault. The last act in tne
          receiving vault was performed at Holmes'
          express command.
          The lid of the coffin was taken off and
          the body was lifted out and laid on the
          ground. Then the bottom of tbe coffin
          was filled with cement. The body was
          then replaced in the coffin and covered
          with cement. It was Holmes' idea that
          this cement would harden around his
          body and prevent any attempt at grave
          robbery. The coffin was left in the receiv
          ing vault under the guard of two watch
          men, who will remain on duty all night.
          To-morrow afternoon the body will be in
          terred in a grave in the cemetery, and it is
          probable that at the time religious serv
          ices will be conducted by Father Dailey.
          Holmes made no will and left no con
          fession. This is according to Mr. Rotan.
          He says he knows Holmes made no will,
          and, while the murderer gave him this
          mornine a big bundle of papers, the law
          yer says that he is confident that these
          papers relate only to private business
          matters. A3 yet Mr. Rotan has had no
          opportunity to examine them.
          Mrs, Pietzel was seen after Holmes was
          hanged. All she could say, between her
          sobs, was that she was glad that he had
          received her just deserts, but that his
          death would not return to her her hus
          band or her children. Mrs. Pietzel will
          return to her home, at Galva, 111., next
          week.
          The two women referred to by Holmes
          in nis confession from the scaffold were
          Julia Connor of Chicago and Emily
          Cigrand of Anderson, Ind.
          HOLMES' MANY CRIMES.
          He Had a Ready "Confession" to Clear
          Himself of Ench.
          Herman W. Mudgett, better known as
          H. H. Holmes, was one of the most con
          spicuous criminals of modern times, and
          If the "murder confessions" which he has
          written can only partially be believed, he
          was without a peer as a bloodthirsty
          demon. His recent ingenious "confes
          sion," wherein he claimed to have killed
          twenty-seven persons, was disproved,
          partly, at least, by the appearance of sev
          eral of the so-called victims: but Holmes'
          object in making the "confession" was re
          alized — the obtaining of a sum said to be
          $7500 and which amount is said to have
          been settled upon the criminal's 18-year
          old son. While the "confessions" have
          served to increase the sensationalism of
          the case, the only capital crime for which
          Holmes had to answer was the killing in
          this city on September 2, 1884, of Benja
          min F. Pietzel, bis fellow-conspirator.
          The murder was committed in the dwell
          ing, 1316 Callowhill street. Holmes' con
          viction of murder in the first degree, the
          affirmation by the Pennsylvania Supreme
          Court of the verdict and the recent re
          fusal of Governor Hastings to grant a re
          spite, are so well known that a narration
          oJ these facts is unnecessary.
          Holmes was captured in Boston, Mass.,
          in the latter part of 1894 by Owen Hans

          CRIME CASTLE GUILDER DEAD
          Portland Carpenter Takes Poison Be
          cause He Couldn't Sleep.
          Portland, Mich. Patrick Quinlan.
          who was said to be one of the. few men
          who might have explained the myste
          ries of "Holmes' Crime Castle,' 'which
          was famous in the annals of Chicago
          crime, Is dead at his home near here.
          Before his death he told physicians
          ho had taken poison.
          Quinlan was a carpenter and was
          employed by Dr. J. J. Holmes to
          build the structure. The police held
          him for a time as a possible accom
          plice. Trap-doors, false partitions and
          numbers of wires were part of the
          equipment found'ln the "Castle".
          "He couldn't sleep" was the reason
          given by relatives for Quintan's sui
          cide.

          A few weeks ago word was sent
          over the telegraphic wires that Pat
          rick Qulnlan had killed himself In
          his home at Portland. Mich. The

          of Qulnlan was linked.

          howed that he was only an em

          eill floors. The conveyance was big

          in diameter. It was an ideal stove
          for tho burning of a human body.
          A person could be thrown into the
          stove bodily and could be burned to
          nothing.
          In tho basement were quicklime
          vats. Bodies could be thrown in
          quicklime and consumed. The flag
          ging in the basement could be torn
          up and bodies could bo buried be
          neath the flags.
          The trouble with the average sla

          do with the body of hLs victim.
          FINDING OF BODY
          STARTS SEARCH.
          The finding of the body of a vic
          tim always starts the search for the
          slayer. If a man could dispose of
          tho body he could slay on a whole
          sale plan and avoid detection.
          Holmes is believed to have built the
          castle with a view of hiding bodies
          of those he slew. He directed the
          work on the building. Qulnlan was
          only an ordinary workman who did
          what he was told unhesitatingly.
          Qulnlan never questioned the au
          thority of the slayer. He never
          asked who the women were Holmes
          had visiting him. He never asked
          where they went when they disap
          peared. He was an ideal servant.
          Born in a small Michigan commun
          ity he went to Chicago to make his
          fortune. Chicago was about to have
          a world's fair in commemoration of
          the. discovery of America.
          It was a good town to go to,
          thought Quinlan. An honest Irish
          young man, hla only thought of mak
          ing a living was by honest hard
          work. That Is why he went to work
          for Holmes and worked so wllllng
          ly and so faithfully. The other day
          w hen he drank the fatal potion he
          was middle-aged and broken in
          health. He looked as though he had
          been carried to the point of death
          by tho ghosts of the slain women of
          the castlo ho helped to build.
          It is said by some of his best
          friends that he often reproarhed
          himself for his part In the affair.
          Ho blamed himself for not suspect
          ing Holmes and turning him up to
          the police. Yet he could not bo
          blamed. Every thing in Holmes Cas
          tle seemed to be right. There was
          no sign of murder there. Every
          thing was quiet and still. The rooms
          were lined with asbestos and the
          dying victims never made a sound
          that reached the outsldo world.
          There at night In tho dark house
          they met their death.
          Some of them wero asphyxiated.
          It la believed. Others wore stabbed.

          Others were shot, according to the
          opinions of investigator. No one
          knows. Holmes knew and the vic
          tims perhaps could tell harrowing
          tales if they could talk, but theyr are
          gone and Holmes has been hung for
          his crimes, so In this world no one
          ever will know.
          How many crimes Holmes devised
          no one can tell. Tho first thing to
          attract the attention of tho world
          was the sudden, horrible death of
          B. F. PSetzel. a ihemlst. in Phila
          delphia He died In such a man
          ner that It seerued ho had been
          making chemical experiments and
          had met with an accident Mien his
          chemicals exploded. Holme-, whoso
          right name was Herman "W. Mucl
          cett, telegraphed to St Louis to the
          homo of Mrs Pletzcl and told her to
          rome to Philadelphia and Identify
          the body.
          It is alleged that Holmes met Mrs.
          Pletzel and informed her the body
          was not that of her husband but
          that her husband had his life in
          sured for 10. 000.
          "He's saf- in Canada." Holmes
          told Mrs Pletzel. "He had itim
          frame up this body. It Is t-o badly
          mangled by the explosion that no
          one can ever recognize it Tou
          identify it and we 11 get the insur
          ance. Your husband said for me to
          gl e you half and bring the otner
          half to him."
          Mrs Pletzel later confessed that
          she Identifcd the body without be
          lieving it was that of her husband.
          She thought it was a big swindle
          game on the part of her husband
          and she entered into it readily She
          brought her three children. Alice,
          Nellie and Howard with her. Alice
          was 15 years old. Holmes sepa
          rated her from her children and
          took them to Toronto, Canada,
          Later the bodies, of Alice and
          Nellie were found In the cellar of a
          building Holmes had occupied at
          Toronto.

          Marian Hedgepeth is the man who
          drat directed attention to Holmes.
          Holmes was conducting a drug atoro
          In St Louis when he was arrested on
          a minor charge and placed In jail.
          There ho met Marion Hedgepeth,
          noted as an out and out criminal.
          Holmes asked Hcdgepeth to tell him
          the name of some St, Louis lawyer
          who could give him assistance In
          putting over an Insurance swindle.

          Hedgepeth said he gave him the
          name. In return Hedgepeth was to
          get $500. The swindle was con
          summated. That is Pletzel was
          killed in Philadelphia in order to col
          let the Insurance, but Hedgepeth got
          no money.
          Then Hedgepeth notified Chief of
          Police Harrlgan of St. Louis that he
          had "the biggest insurance swindle
          case the police ever had to deal
          with anywhere, anytime in the
          world'
          He sent that message to Harrlgan
          October 9. 1894. Pietzel had died
          September 3. 1894. That failure to
          deal squarely with Hedgepeth is
          doubtless what cost Holmes his
          liberty and life and checked his
          long career of crime. Police at
          once set out to hunt for him. The
          Philadelphia death of Pietzel had
          caused them some wonder, but tho
          word from Hedgepeth made them
          doubly cure of crime. They trailed
          Holmes to Toronto, where the
          bodies of Alice and Nellie Pletzel
          were found. Later they found the
          body of Howard In Indianapolis and
          Identified it as that of Howard, be
          cause of some peculiar playthings
          he had. His body had been burned
          In a stove and the bones alone were
          left Intact.
          Holmes was found In Boston and
          arrested. He was going under tho
          name of Howard there. He was ar
          rested July 14. 1895.
          Mrs. Pletzel told her part in the
          afflr and tried to atone by fisht
          lng for the conviction of the man
          who had made her a widow and
          had slain three of her beautiful
          children.
          In Chicago the record of Holmes
          was looked up. When he was un
          der arrest in Philadelphia awaiting
          trial for the death of Pletzel word
          .ame from all parts of tho United
          Slates that Holmes, or a man an
          swering his description, had taken
          women from their town and the
          unfortunates had never been heard
          from
          From Fort Worth came the In
          formation that Miss Minnie Wil
          liams and her sister, Anna, had
          been led away by Holmes several
          years before and no one had ever
          heard of them. It was found that
          Miss Minnie Williams had entered
          Holmes castlo under the supposi
          tion that she was to be the wife of
          the arch-slayer. She sent to Fort
          Worth for her sister. Anna, to be
          a bridesmaid at the w:diing.
          The sisters had JG0.000 worth
          of property In Forth Worth. They
          were induced to borrow heavily on
          the property and that Is the last
          anyone heard of them. Minnie, the
          bride-elect, died before the wedding
          In Holmes Castle Anna, the brides-mald-to-be.
          also died without ever
          having a chance to wear her bridal
          clothes What happened to tho
          bodies no one knows for certain.
          In the fine of the chimney, whlh
          led from the big stove on the top
          floor, hair was found. It Is believed
          that the hair was that of the sisters
          as It corresponded to their hair The
          theory was advanced at the time
          that the sisters were thrown Into the
          stove and burned. The suction of
          the flue carried the hair up In the
          flue, where it remained as mute evi
          dence against Holmes.
          From Davenport, Io., came an
          other story of disappearance and
          Holmes name was linked with that
          too. Mrs.v Julia Connor and her
          daughter were the missing ones.
          BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
          AND DAUGHTER LOST.
          For more than three years prior
          to 1 895, Mrs. Julia 1 Connor and
          her daughter, Pearl, had been mlss-
          ing from their friends in Iowa.
          Mrs. Connor had gone to Chicago
          v.ith her husband and daughter to
          work in a drug store conducted by
          Holmes. The drug store failed and
          Holmes gave the property to Con
          nor. Mrs. Connor was so taken with
          his generosity that she ceased to
          love her husband. She returned to
          Davenport and Connor obtained a
          divorce.
          Then she returned to Chicago, os
          tensibly to open a boarding house
          in Chicago or the suburbs. She and
          hor daughter never were heard of
          again. When Holmes was arrested
          in Philadelphia, relatives of Julia
          Connor claimed he killed her.
          Many bones wero found around
          Holmes Castle. He explained they
          were beef bones. He explained that
          the flat had been used as a restau
          rant during the World's Fair at Chi
          cago and that much meat was used
          there. He explained that the huge
          dumb waiter was used to convey
          food. He explained that the as
          bestos was to make the house fire
          proof and to keep out cold.
          He had an excuse for everything.
          He admitted he was crooked. He
          explained that he went to Toronto
          to smuggle furs into the United 111?!
          States. He admitted knowing alt
          the women ho was accused of mur-
          dering He admitted knowing Piet- Ewg
          zel. He denied killing any of them. Hl
          Damaging evidence against him Bb
          were buttons of the women he was KhI
          charged with killing, which were
          found in his castle. bIH
          But the defense of Holmes netted LH
          him nothing. He swung from the hI
          gallows for his crimes.
          Though Holmes paid for his mis- jlfl
          deeds with death, Qulnlan suffered Bl
          much more than he. He was ar- LH
          rested with Holmes but freed.
          When he went back to his Mlchl- W
          gan home he found himself the cen- Btf
          ter of eyes Everywhere he went he
          was stared at or else he felt he B .
          was stared at. While the rest of K'
          the world forgot Holmes, the little Be- ' .
          town Where he lived always re- K ''
          hearsed the story. .
          No wonder the honest Irish Janl- flk I

          IN HOLMES' CHICAGO CARfil'
          Another Piece of Bone, a Bloody
          Sponge and Blood-Stntned
          Bench Are Found.
          St. Paul, July 28.—That Holmes, the
          alleged Chicago slaughterer, once
          lived in St. Paul and was a lawyer of
          unsavory reputation, has been asserted
          and denied, and now the statement is
          made onve more, and Chief Clark,
          John O'Connor, Detective Dally and
          Detective Kenealey are of the opinion
          that he is the very man who once
          figured here. He was of the genus at
          torney known as shyster, aud used to
          take small caseB when opportunity of
          fered. He married Mary O'Brien, a mil
          liner who was crippled, and who had
          saved from her earnings a few hun
          dred dollars. He was at one time as
          sociated with Nachtsheim in the res
          taurant business, and did him up to ft
          considerable amount. The time re
          ferred to is over twelve years ago.
          Chicago, July 28—Workmen at Swin
          dler Holmes' morgue dug up a piece of
          bone, and Dr. Robinson says it is part
          of a human anatomy. An old sponge
          and an old bench were also found, dis
          colored with blood. A chemical an
          alysis will be made.
          Toronto, Ont., July 28.—While the
          police and detectives are eager for the
          extradition of Holmes, it is learned
          that the attorney general Is not anx
          ious to be put to the expense and,
          trouble of the trial if a conviction
          upon a capital charge can be had else
          where. Deputy Attorney General
          Cartwrlght is very emphatic in
          Omaha, July ?8.—It is now estab
          lished to the satisfaction of the local
          police that H. H. Holmes, swindler
          and murderer, has an Omaha record,
          some time ago, when the Holmes
          crimes were first made public, photo
          graphs of the man were sent to all
          the police stations of the country, to
          gether with the photographs of the
          people who were missing and sup
          posed to have been murdered by him
          and his accomplices. These photo
          graphs have been in the hands of the
          officers here and they now claim to
          have positive evidence that Holmes
          was in Omaha in 1891 for a short
          time, and was here again in 1893 for
          several months in the employ of tho
          Elkhorn railroad as a special officer.
          Omaha police say that at thnes
          Holmes, or Howard, as he was known
          then, was implicated with the Hedgs
          peth train robbery gang, which sus
          picion led to his discharge by the rail
          road company.

          The building of H. H. Holmes, the
          noted criminal and swindler, was
          burned in Chicago Monday. This is
          the spot that a few weeks ago was
          attracting the attention of the en
          tire country because of the wonder
          ful discoveries of supposed crimes
          and murders within its walls. All
          traces are now destroyed, and
          Holmes will likely only have to
          serve out his sentence of two years
          in the Philadelphia prison for swind
          ling the Fidelity Mutual Insurance
          Company out of $10,000 on the life of

          have glven up the hope of fixing upon him
          the responsibility for the death of the man
          found in the Callowhill strect house, this
          city, and who It was supposed was the

          MRS, PITZEL,
          (Mother of the murdered ehildren.)
          Holmes asserts that in October of last
          year he was in Toronto, where he had lefl
          the Pitzel children in charge of Minnle
          Willlams, the girl he mot in Chicago.
          He asserts that he knew nothing of what
          became of them after that time, and he
          always believed the Willlams girl had
          taken them to Europe. He also insists
          that he knew nothing of the boy, and that
          he had nothing to do with the death of
          Pitzel.

          CHICAGO, July 22.—It is the inten­
          tion of the Chicago police to make
          every effort to have H. H. Holmes, the
          insuranoe swindler, brought here to
          answer the charge of having murdered
          the Williams girls. Local officers are

          GflpCAao, July 22.—A local paper
          fts:: To the long list of murders and
          othei* crimes directly traceable' to the
          arch fiend, H. H. Holmes, must now
          be added the mysterious disappearance
          of Mrs. I. L. Conner and her 18-year
          old daughter, with a reasonable cer­
          tainty that they may have been dis­
          posed of in the same manner in which
          the-rest of his victims met their death.
          Mtti. Conner and her child, were last
          seen in the company of Holmes in this
          city in 1893. Sinoe then alL trace of
          them has been lost, and the shrewdest
          detectives, who, at the instigation of
          the woman's family, have been work­
          ing on the case, are now of the opin­
          ion that the finding of their' bodies is
          the only possible solution of the mys­
          tery.
          Was an Iowa Woman.
          Mm, Conner came originally from
          Davenport, la., where she was married
          to I. L. Conner, a jeweler, nearly 15
          years ago. To them aiGhild was born,
          and in 1889 Conner and his wife and
          girl, then 7 or 8 years old, came to Chi­
          cago. Holmes at that tiiao was just be­
          ginning to frame- the swindles for
          whioh he later became notorious, and.
          had started a drug and jewelry store in.
          Englewood. Conner went to work for
          Holmes and moved his family into?*
          flat over the store. It was not long:
          after this that Conner became aware
          that the relations between his wife
          and Holmes were not of a nature con­
          sistent with the-laws of society aud he
          soon left her. Before long Mrs. Con­
          ner and the child disappeared and no
          trace of them has sinoe been found.

          Nothing Else," Says Dis?

          Lansing Insures German
          Ambassador's Return
          Trom To? Trlbiir.f Bur??'.!
          Washington, Feb B. Count Johann
          von Bernstorff received the first news
          of his dismissal at 10:30 to-day from a
          group of newspaper correspondents
          who went te SOC him immediately after
          it was announced. He expreased regret,
          but hardly any furprise. Ever since
          Wednesday, when he delivered his gov?
          ernment's note to Secretary Lansing,
          he had been expecting this move.
          "I am sorry to hear thi?. gentlemen."
          he said. "But I suppose the United
          States government felt it could do
          nothing elae"
          A few hours later Lester H. Woolsey.
          assistant solicitor of the State Depart?
          ment, left for the embassy with the BIB?
          bassador's pasi-ports and the American
          note atating the reasons for the hreak
          ?n relations. He arrived in Count von ?
          Bernstorffv ??tudy and presented the
          documents at exactly 2 o'clock, Just as
          President Wilson mounted the rostrum
          n the House Chamber to address Con?
          gres?.
          Smiling but Regretful
          After Woolsey left the ambassador
          again received the newpnner men.
          "I am just a private citisea now," he
          betrun. "Therefore ? cannot tell you
          anything except nbout myself. I have
          received my paasports and a note from
          Mr. Lansing. I have turned over the
          embassy interests to Dr. Ritter, the
          Swiss Slinister. and I must refer you
          to him for all information concerning
          my government, as I no longer repre
          ?ent it."
          The ambassador wore his usual t mile,
          but through it could be discerned plain?
          ly a feeling of sorrow. Count von
          Bernstorff has many friends in Wash?
          ington. He has taken a large part in
          society life, and is known widely in
          society circles in New York and else?
          where.
          But greater than his regret at leav?
          ing these associations is the disappoint?
          ment at the outcome of his effort? to
          prevent a break with the United States.
          Prevented Rupture Earlier
          Ever since the Lusitunia was sunk
          Bernstorff has labored earnestly to pre?
          vent a rupture. To his cleverness in
          patching up the disputes that have
          arisen since that time is due the fact
          that relations were not broken long
          ago.
          In his efforts he used every means
          at his disposal. Particularly he em?
          ployed the press of the T'nited StateF.
          After the departure of I?r. Bernhard
          Demburg. the official German press
          propagandist, who was withdrawn at
          the request of the State Department,
          Bernstorff took up newspaper publicity
          seriously. His daily conferences with
          newspaper men here are credited with
          having inspired more "stories" than
          all other news sources in Washington
          combined.
          He almost never permitted himself
          to be quoted. But, on the understand?
          ing that all he said was to be used
          merely for the "guidance" of the news?
          paper men, he talked freely. It has
          been said often that he never said any?
          thing to a new^parcr man that he was
          not willing and erea anxious to have
          printed. He treated all alike "confi?
          dentially" bat gave nobody his real
          confidence.

          K.o de Janeiro, Feh. ?V- In an inter-'
          view her? to-day, Deputy Aue*usto de
          Souza e Silva predicted that the United
          States would be drawn into the wai
          ar.d said that it would be supported hy
          Braail. The deputy praiaed the efforts
          of President Wilson for peace, and
          continued :
          "Mr. Wilson seems to have foreseen
          that Germany would compel the United
          States to abandon neutrality and take
          aides with the Allies in defence of the
          interests and rights of the American
          people. He will not be aile to avert
          the entrance of the United States into
          the conflict, but he stands already
          justified before American public
          opinion and before the world, because
          he has done everything to prevent de?
          velopment of the most terrible phase
          which the war can reach.
          "Although the capture or sinking of
          belligerent merchantmen or of neutral
          merchantmen carrying contraband,
          outside of territorial waters, is not an
          Illegal act, nevertheless the effect of
          such sinkings on nublic opinion and
          the damage caused to 'he general eco?
          nomic situation are sufficient to com
          pel Brazil to modify her attitude o
          neutrality and support the action o
          1 the United States to safeguard na
          i tional rights and interests.

          tral r.ationa i:i the opinion of "A
          Noite." Th?? paper say?:
          "Nobody will deny that the act of
          Germany is perfectly logical in the
          face of the attitude of the I'nited
          States, the strongest neutral nation,
          with regard to the preceding events.
          The German defiance is the logical con?
          sequence of the timidity shown by
          neutral nations."

          was announced today. The state, de

          letter written by Foreign Secretary
          Zimmerman of Germany had never
          reached Carranza, hence never reach
          ed" Japan.
          It is cited in the note that Zim

          the subject to Carranza only when it
          was certain there would be a break
          in war with the United tSates. It
          is also cited that this had not devel
          oped when "Von Bernstorff left the
          United States.
          Secretary Lansing thinks Mexico
          would ignore such a proposal on ac
          count of friendly relations.
          The state department refused to
          give out the source of the letter lest
          some lives be endangered, but added
          full evidence was had that the letter
          had reached von Bernstorff and also
          the German minister to Mexico.

          Washington, March 1.Germany,
          in planning unrestricted submarine
          warfare and counting its consequen
          ces, proposed an alliance with Mex
          ico and Japan to make war on the
          United States, if this country should
          not remain neutral.
          Japan, through Mexican media
          tion, was to be urged to abandon her
          allies and join in the attack on the
          United States.
          Mexico, for her reward, was to re
          ceive general financial support from
          Germany, re-conquer Texas, New
          Mexico and Arizonalost provinces
          and share in the victorious peace
          terms Germany contemplated.
          Details were left to German Min
          ister von Eckhardt in Mexico City,
          who by instructions signed by Ger
          man Foreign Minister Zimmerman,
          at Berlin, January 19, 1917, was di
          rected to propose the alliance with
          Mexico to General Carranza and sug
          gest that Mexico seek to bring Japan
          into the plot.

          In a fast game at the Armory last
          evening the Bemidji high school team
          defeated the Park Rapids quintet by
          score of 71 to 15. Although out

          ark Rapids team put P Sa

          stact that they were on a large floor
          and handicapped by not being used
          to out of beflrnda.
          The playing of Plummer at right
          forward was the feature of the game.
          He made a total of 19 points for his
          team and also prevented his man
          from scoring. His floor work was
          brilliant and there is no question but
          what Captain Plummer will make a
          strong bid for all-state forward this
          year.

          the guard position instead of his
          flisual position as right forward he
          made ten baskets for his home team.

          well as did Warfleld at center. Gam

          are making hhn persona non grata to

          to-day, when the Administration's dls
          plcasiite and embarrassment were openly
          extiresil over the latest pio-German
          move which has emanated from the
          Swiss Legation.

          concerning the situation mid arguments
          from the German viewpoint, was made

          Another Cane Ilecnllcd.
          Tho Indignation of the Administration
          Is not due particularly to the contents of
          the despatch, but to the fact that Dr.
          ltltter seems to be following In the foot
          steps of Count von Hernstorff and en
          deavoiing to conduct a pro-ucrman
          brooaganda In this country. State l)e
          Dartment officials tako the view that his
          present duties as representing Germany's
          interests do not entitle him to play any
          such role. He Is supposed to act dimply
          as an Intermediary between Herlln and
          Washington and not to show sympathy
          and undue zeal for the promotion of
          such political move as the Wllhelm-
          Htrasse wishes to conduct.
          It Is furthermore explained that the
          present Instanco of giving out Germany's
          sldo of a controversy without this Gov
          ernment's permission Is not the first case
          which has attracted tho Administration's

          It is regarded as certain that the

          WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. The Associated Press is enabled
          to reveal that Germany, in planning unrestricted submarine
          warfare and counting its consequences, proposed an alliance
          with Mexico and Japan to make war on the United States if
          this country should not remain neutral. Japan, through Mexi
          can mediation, was to be urged to abandon her allies and join
          in the attack on the United States.
          Mexico, for her reward, was to 'receive general financial
          support from Germany, reconquer Texas, New Mexico and
          Arizona her "lost provinces" and share in the victorious
          peace terms Germany contemplated.
          Details were left to German Minister von Kukhardt in .Mexico city,
          who by instructions signed by German Foreign Minister Zimmermann at
          Berlin January 19, 1917, was directed to propose the alliance with Mexico
          to Gen. Carranza and suggest that Mexico seel; to bring Japan into tho
          plot.
          These instructions wero transmitted to Von Kckhardt through Count
          von Bernstorff, former German Ambassador here, now on his way home
          to Germany under a safe conduct obtained from his enemies by tho
          country against which he was plotting war.
          Painted Germans as Victors.
          " Germany pictured to Mexico by broad intimation Kngland and the
          Entente Allies defeated, Germany and her allies triumphant and in world
          domination by the instrument of unrestricted submarine warfare.
          A copy of Zimmermunn's instructions to Von Kckhardt sent through
          Von Bernstorff is in possession of the United States Government. It is
          equipped with heavy enough armament! An attack has been made on tho Ger-,

          Debate on thu measure had been lim
          ited by tho drastic rule under which It
          lad been brought UP so that the usual
          ter here,
          Houso Is reasonably certain, but In the
          Senate, whero the greatest dlfliculty
          Is to be met, there were renewed
          threats to-day of a filibuster to forco a
          special session of Congress'.
          Tho situation to-night appeared
          largely to depend on tho action of
          Senator La Follctte, wlio although In
          dicating by his action a purpose to de
          lay legislation, has not declared his
          purpose to filibuster to the extent of
          blocking a vote on this nmt other Im
          portant measures remaining to bo
          acted upon by the Senate.
          His attitude was Indicated after the
          passage of the revenue bill to-night.
          Senator Stone, chairman of the Foreign
          Belatlons Committee, sought unanimous
          consent to dispense with parliamentary
          formalities In virder to get formally be
          fore the Senate the neutrality measures
          as reported by tho committee which
          would authorize tho President to arm
          American ships and employ "other in
          strumentalities" to protect American
          life and rights on the sea.
          Prompt obpectlon came from Senator
          La Follette, who Insisted upon consum
          ing lme reading tho Journal of previous
          d.ivs. over the vieoious obiectlon of Sen
          ators Fall and Polndexter, Bepubllcans, , as follows:

          After several hours the prohibition

          the House bill reported fiom the District
          of Columbia Committee, with numerous

          minority of his committee. He suc
          ceeded in keeping tho bill from coming
          up on the floor until afternoon by fili
          bustering on a minor Judgeship measure.
          He l.ad a handful of other bills ready
          to bring up when llepresentative Harri

          Henry Makes Protest.
          Mr. Henry protested that undue haste
          Miould not be exercised In perfecting
          fcuch an Important measure, and -Mr.
          Harrison replied :
          "We are willing to sit here with you
          suitlemon until tho fourth of March, If
          r.tcessary, to perfect tills bill."
          A point of no quorum by Itepresenta
          tUe Coady of Maryland was followed
          by a rush of tho untl-prohlbltlon Ilepre
          sentatlves to absent themselves, and
          'here was a long delay whllo the
          feigeant-at-arms was bringing them
          back Into the Houso chamber.
          Then It developed that the filibusters
          were ready to demand roll culls on a
          long Ubi of amendments, with frequent
          roll calls pn motions to adjourn In
          terspersed, and the prohibition leaders
          abandoned tho committee bill and
          brought in tho rule to substitute the
          innate measure, It was udopted, 212 to
          Hi. and a roll call on tho bill Itself I
          "on was leached. I
          llepresentative Galllvan of Massachu-I

          While the voting was in progress In
          the Iluuke William J. Bryan walked Into '
          'he pn-ss gallery, watched the proceed-,
          ngs for a while, and then went down to
          the Sveaker's lobby and talked with
          friends among the members.
          "I was In on the killing," he said after
          the llnal vote. "Just say for mo Hint I

          Viewed In combination with the con
          tinuing retirement, this statement In
          creases, the wonderment ns to where It

          numbers is the all Important factor. It.
          Is held that a German U-boat would

          For the first time since Ger
          many began her unrestricted sub
          marine campaign no reports were
          received yesterday from London
          or from Paris of ships having ,
          been torpedoed by submarines or
          sunk by mines.
          The British official weekly
          statement of arrivals and sailings
          and submarine depredations con
          tains, however, a striking con
          trast. It supplies the following
          data:
          Arrivals and sailings, merchant
          vessels of all nationalities over
          ioo tons net, at and from British
          ports: Arrivals, .,280; sailings,

          The announcement that the
          three Dutch ships torpedoed on
          February 22 and believed still
          afloat had sunk increases the to
          tal known losses by three ships
          and 13,810 tons over previous fig

          4,189 tons.
          Data available in this country

          at last Is widely illscuseed,
          That Entente leaders believe there are
          Eieal possibilities In the situation Is
          evidenced by tho fact that a conference
          of the highest British and Fiench com
          manders of Government and army was
          held at Calais on Monday. 'Sven the fact
          of tho conference was kept secret until
          It was over, but thoro is 110 doubt hero
          that It centred upon tho German retire
          ment on the Ancre and how the Allies
          might best take advantage of It.
          Great Britain sent to tho conference

          The Somme-Ancie front continues to
          be the ceiitro of Interest on the western
          battle line, but iahls and small recon
          noitring attacks at other points on that
          front by both British and French troops
          are doubtless with the Intention of as
          certaining whether or not tho Germans
          are preparing a wider retirement.

          United States government, is as fol­

          "On the first of February we intend
          to begin submarine warfare unre­

          "If this attempt is not succcssful,
          we propose an' alliance on the follow­
          ing basis with Mexico: That we shall
          make war together and together
          make peace. We shall give general
          financial support, and it is under­
          stood that Mexico is to reconquer the

          Germany and Japan.
          "Please call to the attention of the

          An accummulation of annoying acti­
          vities of Dr. Paul Ritter, Swiss minis­
          ter to United States, and Germany's
          indirect representative here, tended to
          put him in a persona nongrata state in
          which German Ambassador von Bern
          storff found himself during his propa­
          ganda scheme during the last two
          years.
          While some privately believe Rit­
          ter not only accepted von Bernstorff's
          work in the United
          States,
          but he also
          took up his propaganda work. What
          chiefly interested the president and
          Secretary Lansing was that he made
          peace suggestions to newspapermen
          several hours before
          the
          state depart­
          ment had any news of them.
          It is understood the German peace
          plan originated from Ritter himself,
          and not from the German government.

          Members of congress, many of

          Washington, March 1.—Senator
          Ledge's resolution for full facts
          of Germany's Mexican-Japanese
          plot reads:
          "That the president be request*
          ed to inform the senate whether
          the note signed "Zimmermann,"
          published In newspapers of the
          morning of March 1, inviting Mex­
          ico to unite with Germany and
          Japan in war against the United
          States, is authentic and in pessaa
          session of the government of the
          United 8tates and, if authentic,
          to send to the senate, if net in*
          compatable with the public inters
          est, all further information jn
          possession of the United States
          government relative to activities
          of the imperial German govern
          men in Europe."
          Senator La Follette suggested
          that the administration be aske4
          to say how long it had been in
          possession of the Zimmerman plot
          letter, and this risquest was
          ed to Lodge's original requej'
          (Uniteil ^iress:)
          Washington, Mur^k 1. 'President
          Wilson stuuds sionsor for the declara­
          tion planned to pplot with Mexico and
          Japan in a conspiracy' against the
          United States. Senator La Foll«tt0
          in tbe Senate today said:
          "President Wilson has authorized me
          to say that the Zimmerman letter pro­
          posing an alliance with Japan and
          Mexico is substantially correct."
          This statement followed the introduc­
          tion by Senator Lodge inquiring as to
          the correctness of the letter. Senator
          La Follette wanted the Lodge resolution
          so modified that It would bring out the
          facts when the letter reached this gov­
          ernment. Senator Lodge acceded to
          the modification. Senator Hardwlck
          indicated his intention to object, say­
          ing it was a serious matter and the
          .President could be relied upon to in­
          form the Senate on the matter if Ue
          deemed it wise.
          Lodge Flares Up.
          Senator Lodge flared up. "I put it
          in because it is a serious matter," he
          said. "If it is true, Congress should
          -kuow ubout it." Senator Works said
          it was due to Congress and the country
          that President Wilson fully present to
          Congress all information he may have
          on the matter. To stave off an extra
          session, the administration played its
          trump card in publishing the corre­
          spondence between the German and
          Mexican representatives, whereby it.
          sought to align Japan and Mexico as
          one against the United States.
          Administration's Answer.
          Publication of the Mexican note is
          answer to the administration's appar­
          ent anxiety for Japan as shown in Us
          efforts to kill the anti-alien legislation
          aimed at the Japs. It is tbe answer
          to the President going slowly in order
          that he might be better prepared for
          act ion when the time comes. Above all,
          it is the goad to Congress. Just'how
          Mexico and Japan have taken the Ger­
          man proposals is not definitely known.
          Only a short time ago, Carranta sug­
          gested that an embargo be placed on
          all supplies to the Allies and there was
          a hint that the Mexicau oil supplies to
          the British would be halted. Jppnn
          would have leeu in serious trouble bad
          the anti-alien bill passed. 4
          Stringent Spy Bill.
          The Mexican-Japan case has loomed
          larger than the administration agreed
          to make public. All envoys froof tie
          two countries are going back, and It
          .recalls tbe Japanese regatherinfc li
          large numbers in Lower California. $t
          recalls the activity of General Boyd
          and of General Von Papen in Mexico
          aud others south of the Rio
          It is given frankly, but not
          as the reason Secretary Lansing
          sent before Congress to dead for the
          most stringent and rigid spy bill ttris
          government has ever considered.
          Germany's attempt to allien Mexi­
          co and Japan in a hostile conspiracy
          against the United States has tw
          frustrated. At the state department
          today it was intimated that so far As
          it has been learned, the letter of-Mob
          later Zimmermann, vouchsafed

          German Plot story
          Is Confirmed
          Envoy Von Eckhardt May Be
          Compelled to Quit Mexican
          Capital
          WASHINGTON, March 1. Complete and elaborate con
          firmation that Germany has endeavored to line up Mexico and
          Japan as enemies of the United States is in the hands of President
          Wilson.
          As a result representations now are being made to General
          Carranza at Mexico City which may result in the withdrawal from
          Mexico of German diplomatic agents and possibly of the German
          minister to Mexico, Count von Eckhardt.
          These representations are shrouded in complete secrecy by
          the administration but it is admitted that General Carranza al
          ready has been given to understand that the German plotting
          against the United States on Mexican soil is a "grossly unfriend
          ly act."
          The entire international situation so far as the relations be
          tween the United States and Germany are concerned was ex
          tremely serious today. This latest manifestation of unfriendli
          ness, complete proof of which has been gathered by the agents of
          the United States, reveals a plot 01 such widespread ramifications
          and serious enmity toward the United States as to be almost un
          believable. It is thought here that witnin a very short time the
          President will let all of the facts become known, either through
          a direct statement to Congress from the White House or a com
          munication to the foreign affairs committee of the Senate by Sec
          retary of State Robert Lansing.
          The text of the note written by German Foreign Minister '
          Zimmermann to Count von Eckhardt, which was dated January |
          19 and was sent to Mexico through Count von Bernstorff, the
          German ambassador here at that time, has been in the hands of I
          President Wilson for several days. It is not stated where it came
          from, but it is known that its existence first was reported to the ,
          United States by Ambassador Fletcher when he reached Mexico!
          City to take over his duties there as the new American ambas
          sador to Mexico.
          The Zimmerman note was delivered to Von Eckhardt in Mex
          ico through von Bernstorff's hands and was delivered to the Ger
          man minister in Mexico City. The latter, according to certain
          information which leaked out here, decided that it would not be
          advisable to communicate the plot to Carranza. Instead, certain
          Mexicans who were known to be unfriendly to Carranza, were let
          into the secret. They agreed to the plot, it is understood, and 1
          decided that, in the event that war between the United States
          and Germany took place they would arrange for a new revolution
          to seize the government and depose Carranza.
          The details of what transpired are withheld by this Govern
          ment because of the danger that would come to certain inform
          ants. And in this connection Secretary of State Lansing today
          said that he was not prepared to say whether there would be ad
          aitional revelations.
          All oi the facts in the plot were placed in the possession of the
          Japanese ambassador by Counsellor Polk of the State Department.
          He cabled them at once to Tokyo. It is expected here that a state
          ment dealing with the facts will shortly be forthcoming from the
          Japanese government itself.

          Washington, March 2. Aroused by
          the disclosure of Germany's plot to
          unite Japan and Mexico with her in a
          war upon the United States and then
          convinced by official evidence of its
          authenticity, congress Thursday
          abandoned the delays and obstruc
          tions which have checked President
          Wilson's efforts to be clothed with ex
          press,authority to deal with the sub-'
          marine menace.
          The house after a ten hour debate
          and by 403 to 13 passed a bill to em-
          power the president to arm merchant
          ships and providing tor a $iuu,uuu,-

          does not contain the grant of authori

          position that it came from one of Ger
          many's enemies, was defeated after a
          sharp and sensational debate. Instead
          the senate merely asked for ofiicial
          notice of the authenticity of the dis
          patch from the German foreign min
          ister to Minister von Eckhardt in
          Mexico City. The president trans
          mitted it immediately with the state-
          ment that it would not becompati-
          ble with the public interest to reveal
          further details concerning it.

          This document has been in the
          hands of the government since Presi-'
          dent Wilson broke relations with
          Germany. It has been kept secret
          while the Dresident was asking con
          gress for full authority to deal with
          Germany and while congress has
          been hesitating. It was in the presi-' food, and munitions to the entente al

          MISSING LINK IN CHAIN OF CIR
          CUMSTANCES. The document supplies the missing
          link to many separate chains of cir

          lead'to no definite point. Itshedsnew

          It adds another chapter to the cele-
          SUBMAR1NE BASE IN GULF OF
          MEXICO.
          It gives new credence to persistent
          reports that there are submarine bases
          in Mexican territory in the Culf of
          Mexico.
          It takes cognizance of a fact long
          recognized by American army chiefs
          that if Japan ever undertook to in-
          vadethe United states it probably
          would be through Mexico, oer the
          border into the Mississippi valley, to
          split the country in two.

          For This Country.
          Washington, Mar. 2. The Asso
          ciated Press is enabled to reveal that
          Germany, in planning unrestricted
          submarine warfare and counting its
          consequences, proposed an alliance
          with Mexico and Japan to make war
          upon the United States, if this country
          should not remain neutral.
          Japan, through Mexican machina
          tion, was to be urged to abandon her
          allies and join in an attack upon the
          United States.
          Mexico, for her reward, was to re
          ceive general financial support from
          Germany, reconquer Texas, New
          Mexico and Arizona, her lost pro

        <text> ara Contests PM Against t). S. BERLIN, Via Sayville. March 3.— Foreign Secretary
          Zimmerman today justified Germany's action in seeking to ally Mexico and japan against the
          United States. Such a course, he said, was merely a defensive measure— not to be carried
          out except in case the United States de clared war on Germany. Moreover, he says, it was
          no more a "plot" than the "plot" which was reported in South Ameri can newspapers as
          having been undertaken against Germany by the United States when America sought, according
          to South American and other newspaper reports, to line up the American republics in common
          action against Germany. The foreign secretary commented on America's pro-ally sympathies.
          He refrained from admitting specifically his au thority for the letter to Minister
          Eckhardt at Mexico City, and his entire discussion of the matter was. he was careftil to
          state, based on "English reports" of the "German plot to get Mexico to declare war against

          Carranza Told to Recon
          quer Texas, Arizona
          and New Mexico.
          Washington, March 3. On Friday
          morning the Western Newspaper
          Union was enabled to reveal that Ger
          many in planning unrestricted subma
          rine warfare and counting its conse
          quences, proposed an alliance with
          Mexico and Japan to make war on the
          United States if this country should
          not remain neutral.
          Japan, through Mexican mediation,
          was to be urged to abandon her allies
          and join in the attack on the United
          States.
          Mexico, for her reward, was to re
          - ceive general financial support from
          Germany, reconquer Texas, New Mex
          ico and Arizona lost provinces and
          share in the victorious peace terms
          Germany contemplated.
          Details of the Plot.
          Details were left to German Min
          ister von Eckhardt in Mexico City,
          who by Instructions signed by Ger
          man Foreign Minister Zimmermann
          at Berlin January 19, 1917, was direct
          ed to propose the alliance with Mex
          ico to General Carranza and suggest
          that Mexico seek to bring Japan into
          the plot.
          These instructions were transmitted
          to Von Eckhardt through Count von
          Bernstorff, former German ambas
          sador here, now on his way home to
          Germany under a safe conduct ob
          tained from his enemies by the coun
          try against which he was plotting
          war.
          Pictures World Dominion.
          Germany pictured to Mexico by
          broad intimation England and the en
          tente allies defeated; Germany and
          her allies triumphant and in world
          domination by the instrument of un
          restricted warfare.
          A copy of Secretary Zimmermann's
          instructions to Von Eckhardt, sent
          through Von Bernstorff, is in posses
          sion of the United States government.
          Duplicity Is Exposed.
          The document has been in the hands
          of the government since President Wil
          son broke-off diplomatic relations with
          Germany. It has been kept secret
          while the president has been asking
          congress for full authority to deal with
          V Germany, and while congress has been
          hesitating. It was in the president's
          hands while Chancellor von Bethmann
          Hollweg was declaring that the United
          States had placed an interpretation on
          the submarine declaration "never in
          tended by Germany" and that Ger
          many had promoted and honored
          friendly relations with the United
          States "as an heirloom from Frederick
          the Great.'
          Of itself, if there were no other it
          Is considered a sufficient answer to the
          German chancellor's plaint that the
          United States "brusquely" broke off re
          lations without giving "authentic" rea
          sons for its action.
          Supplies Missing Link.
          The dopument supplies the missing
          link to many separate chains of cir
          cumstances, which until now have
          seemed to lead to no definite point.
          It sheds new light upon the frequent
          ly reported but indefinable movements
          of the Mexican government to couple
          Its situation with the friction between
          the United States and Japan.
          It adds another chapter to the cele
          brated report of Jules Cambon, French
          ambassador In Berlin before the war,
          of Germany's world-wide plans for stir
          ring strife on every continent where
          they might aid her in the -struggle -for
          world domination which she dreamed
          was close at hand. . .
          It adds a climax to the operations of
          Count von Bernstorff and the German
          embassy in this country, which have
          been colored with passport frauds,
          charges of dynamite plots and intrigue,
          'the full extent of which never has been
          published.
          - Emphasizes Our Perils.
          It gives new credence to persistent
          reports of submarine bases on Mexi
          can territory In the Gulf of Mexico;
          It takes cognizance of a fact long rec
          ognized by American army chiefs,
          that if Japan ever undertook to in
          vade the United States , It probably
          would be through Mexico, over the
          border and Into the Mississippi valley
          to split the country in two,

          stmctions jo the German
          Minister Jto Mexiqo.
          Berlin. Jan. 19, 1917. On the 1st of
          February we intend to begin subma
          rine warfare unrestricted. In spite of
          this, It is our intention to endeavor
          to keep neutral the United States of
          America.
          If this attempt is not successful we
          propose an alliance on the following
          basis with Mexico: That we shall
          make war together and together make
          peace. We shall Give general financial
          support, and it is understood that
          Mexico is to reconquer the lost terri
          tory in New Mexico, Texas and Ari
          zona. The details are left to you for
          settlement.
          You are instructed to inform the
          president of Mexico of the above In
          the greatest confidence as soon as it
          is certain that there will be an out
          break of war with the United States,
          and suggest that the president or Mex
          ico, on his own initiative, should com
          municate with Japan, suggesting ad
          herence at once to this plan; at tne
          same time offer to mediate between
          Germany and Japan.
          Please call to the attention of the
          president of Mexico that the employ
          ment of ruthless submarine warfare
          now promises to compell England to
          make peace in a few months.
          (Signed) ZIMMERMANN.
          It recalls that Count von Bernstorff
          when handed his passports was very
          reluctant to return to Germany, but
          expressed a preference for asylum In
          Cuba.
          It gives a new explanation to the
          repeated arrests on the border of men
          charged by American military authori
          ties with being German intelligence
          agents.
          Last of all, It seems to show a con
          nection with General Carranza's re
          cent proposal to neutrals that exports
          of food' and munitions to the entente
          allies be cut off, and an intimation
          that he might stop the supply of oil,
          so vital to the British navy, which is
          exported from the Tampico fields.
          What Will Congress Do?
          "What congress will do, and how
          members of congress who openly have
          sympathized with Germany in their
          opposition to clothing the president
          with full authority to protect Ameri
          can rights will regard the revelation
          of Germany's machinations to attack
          the United States is the subject of the
          keenest interest.
          Such a proposal as Germany In
          structed her minister to make to Mexi
          co borders on an act of war, if, actu
          ally, it is not one.
          No doubt exists here now that the
          persistent reports during the last two
          years of the operations of German
          agents not alone in Mexico but all
          through Central America and the West
          Indies are based on fact.
          - There Is now no doubt whatever
          that the proposed alliance with Mex
          ico was known to high Mexican offi
          cials who are distinguished for their
          anti-Americanism. Among them are
          Rafael Zubaran, Carranza's minister
          to Germany, and Luis Cabrera, Car
          ranza's minister of finance.
          The Hand of Mexico.
          It is apparent that the proposal had
          taken definite form when Zubaran re
          turned to Mexico City from Berlin re
          cently. .His return from his foreign
          post was covered by the fact that Car
          ranza had called in many of his diplo
          mats for "conferences."
          Denied at Japanese Embassy.
          It was declared by a high Japanese
          authority on Wednesday night that if
          the German proposal of an ' alliance
          ever reached Tokyo it was regarded as
          merely a new ebullition of German
          "kultur" and that It was thrown in the
          wastebasket where it belonged.

          Mexico City, Mar. 2. H. von Eck
          hardt, German minister to Mexico, de
          clared today that he knew nothing
          about the instructions alleged to have
          been sent to him by Foreign Secre
          tary Zimmermann regarding a German-Mexican
          alliance in the event of
          war between Germany and the United
          States.
          Von Eckhardt made this statement
          in replying to the question whether
          he had followed the instructions al
          leged, to have been sent to him by
          Dr. Zimmermann.
          "You must go to Washington for
          your information," the minister said.
          "If you must say something you may
          say the German minister knows noth
          ing about all this."
          Tamekichi Ohta, charge d'af fairs for
          Japan, declared he had not been ap
          proached in any way with a proposal
          for any alliance with Mexico or Ger
          many against the United States.
          Garza Perez, sub-secretary of for
          eign affairs, now in charge of the for
          eign office, declared he knew nothing
          of the proposals mentioned. If the
          proposal had been presented by Min
          ister Von Eckhardt, which he person
          ally doubted," he said, it was presented
          direct to Minister of Foreign Affairs

          Interned Teuton Ship In American
          Harbors Damaged on Orders From
          Count Von Bernstorff.
          Washington, Mar. 2. Count Von
          Bernstorff. ex-German ambassador,
          was instructed from Berlin to arrange
          the dismantling of German warbound
          ships in American harbor at the same
          time he received the Zimmermann
          note- for transmission to Mexico.
          This added thread in the mesh of
          German intrigue spun around this
          country while Germany was still pro
          testing friendship was allowed to be
          come known-today with the inference
          that full and detailed instructions
          were sent Bernstorff from Berlin to
          make war by this country impossible.
          Officials refused to disclose any of
          the other elements in the German
          plot, but indicated that it was general
          and wholesale.
          The next step expected from .abroad
          is a complete statement by Mexico
          of her attitude. Deite the long chain
          of suspicious circumstances tending
          to connect ' that country with Ger
          many's intrigues, officials expect an
          indignant repudiation by the Carranza
          government.
          It is assumed also that Japan will
          take advantage of the opportunity to
          reaffirm her loyalty to the Entente
          and her friendship for this country.
          The text of the German instructions
          have been shown to the Japanese am
          bassador here and both Ambassador
          Fletcher at Mexico City and Ambas
          sador Guthrie at Tokio have been
          cabled full information as to the situ
          ation and are expected to discuss the
          matter informally with the respective
          foreign offices.
          A new press campaign by Germany
          to discredit and counteract the dis
          closure is looked for.

          will preside over the house during the coming war period. The house elected him this after
          noon after a speech and war prayer. Representative Sehall, Independent, from Missouri,
          swung his rote to Clark, holding that patriotism demanded that this be done in this
          crisis. The' action of tlie blind representa­ tive was unexpected. "In about 82,WKI voters

          Thousands lined the streets and everywhere were patriotic demon­ strations in favor of

          in his grayer a plea for patriotism. "Diplomacy has fail er," he earnestly prayed. "Moral
          suasion has failed. Appeals to rea­ son and justice have been swept aside." "We abhor war,
          and love peace, but if war has been or shall be forced upon us, we pray that the heart of
          every American citizen may throb with patriotic feeling and that a unit­ ed people may
          rally around our presi­ dent." Nearly the entire senate member* ship was present when Vice
          Presi­ dent Marshall called for order. After the invocation, the president's proc­
          lamation calling the extraordinary session was read. Referred to Problems. In the senate,
          the Chaplain also re­ ferred to the problems confronting congress. "Amid the confusion and

          discussion on the war resolution, which occupied the day, following the senate 82 to 6

          his passports. I shall probably get drunk tonight.” GTi9 news was at Berlin with the noon
          papers on Sunday. Herr Stresemann, who had always been bitter against the United States,
          was finishing a speech before a conservative gathering in which he had argued that America
          would take no action, when some one arose in the audience with the newspaper in his hand.
          A police guard was promptly furnished for the Embassy, but there were no disturbances. On
          Tuesday afternoon Mr. Gerard went alone for a lonk walk through the Berlin streets—was it
          to take a regretful farewell of the city in which, on the whole, he had had such a
          gorgeous time? —and no one offered to molest him. In Berlin there were some em
          barrassments. it is true: but when Mr. Gerard was finally ready to leave he had "a pleas
          ant farewell talk” with both the chancellor and Zimmermann. Count Bernstorff and his Em
          bassy staff at last left Washington on Feb. 14 and sailed from New York next day
          “inexpressibly sad,” as the ambassador wrote in his farewell letter to Colonel House. So
          that link was broken. PUSHING THE CORK THE one element now rapidly emerging as the
          dominant factor in the situation was, strangely enough, the submarine (Copyright. 1935,
          NEA Service. Inc.) campaign. In the moral satisfac tion of bringing retribution down upon
          the faithless Teuton, few had paid much attention to the submarine itself. It was widely
          assumed that the Germans had resorted to the U-boat either from sheer lunacy or merely to
          grati fy their innate lust for crime; and the sobering thought that they might also have
          taken it up because it was a militarily power ful instrument occurred to almost no one. In
          January, the last month of the restricted war, the Germans sank 368,000 tons; in February
          they destroyed 540.000, and the figures were to rise all through March and April. British
          merchant ships and crews continued to sail with stolid courage; but worse than the ac tual
          sinkings was the fact that in the first weeks, at least, neutral shipping was terrorized
          from the seas, just as the Germans had hoped. The short session of Congress would reach
          its end on the 4th of March. Normally, the new Con gress would not meet until De cember,
          and Mr. Wilson would thus be free for nine months from the interference of the legisla
          tive branch and from the uses which partisan politics knew only too well how to make of
          it. Some of the vital appropriations bills, however, were still lagging, and if they
          should fail to pass in the ensuing week Mr. Wilson would be compelled to summon an extra
          session. The Republicans, who were now belaboring the President for his refusal to arm the
          merchant ships, were also maneuvering to block these bills, and so chain him to his
          Congress. This Republican threat to force an extra session upon him was doubtless to have
          something to do with the President’s sudden deci sion to yield on the armed ship issue. In
          the country at large the situation, as Spring Rice re ported that day, was "much that of a
          soda-water bottle with the wires cut but the cork unexplod ed.” But on Saturday, the 24th,
          the British themselves were able to supply something "spectacular.” Mr. Balfour deftly
          gave the un exploded cork a push. THE LACONIA IS SUNK \ T 8:30 Saturday evening there
          arrived in the State Depart ment a sensational cable from Mr. Page. Mr. Balfour had just
          handed him. the ambassador re ported, the text of a cipher tele gram from Zimmermann to
          the German minister in Mexico City, which had been transmitted on Jan. 19 through the
          German Em bassy m Washington itself. The damning text was then given in English
          translation: "We intend to begin on the Ist of February unrestricted subma rine warfare.
          We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the Un-ted States of America neutral. In event
          of this not succeeding we make Mexico a proposal of alli ance on the following basis: Make
          war together, make peace together, generous financial sup port and an understanding on our
          part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas. New Mexico and Arizona. You
          will in form the (Mexican) president of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of
          war with the United States is certain and add the suggestion that he should, on his own
          initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence. ...” The cable arrived on Saturday
          evening. It was some time on Sunday that President Wilson abruptly concluded that an
          appeal to Congress for authority at least to arm American merchant ships was unavoidable.
          On Monday he went again before the joint houses of Congress. In the gray seas off the
          south west of Ireland, only a few hours before the President arose to speak, a German
          submarine had fired a torpedo without warning into the Cunard liner Laconia. Twelve lives
          only were lost out
          of nearly 30 on board) but among
          them were those of two American
          women, Mrs. Mary Hoy and her
          daughter, who died of exposure
          in the small boats on the way into
          Bantry Bay.
          Tire news blazed in the same
          headlines which announced the
          Presidents appeal for authority.
          The President let it be known that
          he regarded the Laconia sinking
          as the overt act for which he
          had been waiting; the armed ship
          bill was revised in more explicit
          terms, and Senator Stone, who
          still believed in peace but who re
          garded it as his duty to support
          the President, reported it out of
          the Foreign Relations Committee
          with a heavy heart.
          But Mr. Polk at the State De
          partment knew of the waiting
          bombshell so kindly supplied by
          Mr. Balfour- The Zimmermann
          telegram, he believed, would pro
          duce a blast of popular emotion
          that would sweep the armed ship
          bill through against everything.
          So did Col. House, who had now
          seen the text, and who was urging
          the President to “publish it to
          morrow.” So, no doubt, did the
          President —to whom it must have
          been plain enough that the first
          effect of Senator La Follette’s
          pacifism would be to deliver Mr.
          Wilson himself into the hands of
          the intransigents. On Tuesday,
          March 1, the headlines were
          shouting from the morning pa
          pers: “GERMANY SEEKS AN
          ALLIANCE AGAINST US; ASKS
          JAPAN AND MEXICO TO JOIN
          HER; FULL TEXT OF PROPO
          SALS MADE PUBLIC.”
          It was a stupendous sensation.
          The telegram was everywhere
          seized upon as final proof of the
          complete and fathomless treach
          ery of the German.
          A MAJOR DISASTER
          WHAT made it particularly
          shocking, of course, was the
          suggestion that the Japanese
          (with whom we were about to be
          come allied) should be invited into
          the American continent, or that
          the principle upon which many
          Americans had demanded the
          restoration of Alsace-Lorraine (be
          cause they had been acquired by
          force) should be applied to Cali
          fornia and Texas, which we had
          forcibly detached from Mexico.
          The Zimmermann telegram be
          came a major German disaster.
          Not its least useful aspect, more
          over, was the fact that it gave the
          northeastern fire-eaters their first
          direct lever upon the pacific senti
          ment of the Southwest.
          If a German triumph threat
          ened the annexation of California
          and Texas to Mexico—! Even be
          fore the editorial repercussions
          had time to roll in, the House, on
          that same Thursday afternoon,
          passed the armed ship bill with a
          vote of 403 to 13.
          In the Senate Mr. Lodge had
          seen at once that the telegram
          would be “of almost unlimited use
          in forcing the situation . . . One
          would think that note would make
          the whole country demand war.”
          Senator La Follette. however, had
          not been made to demand war by
          the Zimmermann telegram and on
          Friday, March 2, he was again
          able to block the armed ship reso
          lution. The Senate paused to vote
          the enormous naval appropriation
          bill, and then went on with the de
          bate.
          Only a few more hours of the
          session remained, and that night
          they sat late under crowded gal
          leries and in an intense excite
          ment.

          BERNSTORFF KNEW.
          Secretary Lansing Gives Out More In
          formation Involving Germany.
          Further evidence that Count von
          Bernstorff, former German ambassa
          ! dor to Washington, knew of his gov
          j ernment's intention to inaugurate a
          campaign of unrestricted submarine
          warfare prior to his request for money
          with which to influence congress is in
          possession of the slate department.
          Secretary Lansing said Wednesday
          that as early as January 19 Count
          j Bernstorff knew of the plan.
          Answering inquiries, the secretary
          made this statement:
          1 'in view of inquiries which have been
          made as to whether Count Bernstorff
          knew of the purpose of his govern
          ment to renew relentless submarine
          warfare when he sent his message of
          January 22. 1917, asking authorization
          to expend $50.000, I can state that the
          department of state possesses conclu
          1 five evidence that on or before Jan
          J ua ry 19 Count Bernstorff had received
          and read the Zimmermann telegram
          to Minister von Eckhardt in Mexico
          ! which contained the following:
          •' 'We intend to begin on the 1st of
          February unrestricted submarine war
          1 fare. We shall endeavor, in spite of
          this, to keep the United States of
          America neutral.'
          •'Count Bernstorff was, therefore,
          fully advised of the intention of the
          I imperial government at the time when
          he asked for authority of Berlin to
          I employ funds for an organization to in
          fluence congressional action in favor
          of the continued neutrality of this
          1 country."

          Time hurried on. There was the great German spy
          scare of the summer of 1915, when Dr. Heinrich Al
          bert, head of the German propaganda service in this
          country, absentmindedly left a
          Notes, Notes briefcase full of incriminating
          Nates P a P ers in a New York elevated
          * train, and a New York newspaper
          got hold of the documents and published them.
          There was the ridiculous Zimmermann incident —
          an intercepted wireless telegram from Berlin to Ger
          many’s Mexican representative, outlining a Mexican
          attack, with German help, on the United States, Mex
          ico to be rewarded with Texas, New Mexico and
          Arizona.
          There were, to repeat, notes upon notes from Wash
          ington to Berlin, all them provocatively self-righteous.
          ♦ * »
          The Great Day turned out to be April 6, 1917. On
          that day, just a month and two days after Wilson’s
          second inauguration, Congress declared war against
          the Imperial German Govern
          “ The Yanks ment —after a desperate anti-
          war filibuster by Senator Robert
          Are Coming MLa Follette the First> of wis _
          eonsin. Wilson told Congress:
          It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people
          . . . into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars . . .
          But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall
          fight for the things which we have always carried
          nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of
          those who submit to authority to have a voice in their
          own governments, for the rights and liberties of small
          nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a
          concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety
          to all nations and make the world itself at last free.
          We were in the war; dragged in by a world-saver,
          a do-gooder, a congenital monkeyer with other peo
          ple’s business. Out of it, we got vastly less than
          nothing. We got 126,000 soldiers killed and died, an
          unpaid war debt, of about $10,000,000,000, and three
          major depressions and two inflationary booms to date.
